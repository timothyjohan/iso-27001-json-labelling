All employees are required to acknowledge in writing their understanding of the Information Security Program which includes a Code of Conduct upon hire and annually thereafter.\n\nThe organization will properly communicate to its workforce and, if appropriate, contractors:\n\nSecurity updates, changes, and incidents, as needed, via email or appropriate Slack channels.\n\nReminders for security responsibilities as part of the annual security awareness training.\n\nCloud Service Customers\n\nCodesphere will develop specific training programs for those involved in the use and management of cloud services, including cloud service business managers, administrators, integrators, and users. The training will address:\n\nStandards and procedures for the use of cloud services.\n\nInformation security risks related to cloud services and the strategies to manage them.\n\nThe risks associated with system and network environments when using cloud services.\n\nThe legal and regulatory considerations applicable to cloud services\n\nThis training will be extended to management and supervisory managers, including those of business units, to ensure the effective coordination of information security activities.\n\nCloud Service Providers\n\nCodesphere employees are expected to conduct similar awareness, education, and training programs as its cloud service customers.\n\nCodesphere will instruct contractors to do the same, ensuring the appropriate handling of customer data and data derived from cloud services.\n\nThis data may contain information confidential to a customer or be subject to specific limitations, including regulatory restrictions, on access and use by Codesphere.\n\nClean Desk/Work Area\n\nAuthorized users will ensure that all sensitive/confidential materials, hardcopy or electronic, are removed from their workspace and locked away when the items are not in use or an employee leaves his/her workstation. This will also increase awareness about protecting sensitive information. As such:\n\nEmployees are required to ensure that all sensitive/confidential information, hardcopy or electronic, is secure in their work area at the end of the day and when they are expected to be gone for an extended period.\n\nComputer workstations must be locked when the workspace is not in use, and must be shut down completely at the end of the day.\n\nSensitive information must be removed from the desk and securely stored when the desk is unattended, and at the end of the day.\n\nLaptops and other portable computing devices must be properly stored/secured.\n\nFile cabinets containing Restricted or Sensitive information must be kept closed and locked when not in use or when not attended.\n\nKeys used for access to Restricted or Sensitive information must not be left at an unattended desk.\n\nPasswords may not be left on sticky notes posted on or under a computer, nor may they be left written down in an accessible location.\n\nPrintouts containing Restricted or Sensitive information should be immediately removed from the printer.\n\nUpon disposal Restricted and/or Sensitive documents should be shredded in the official shredder bins or placed in the lock confidential disposal bins.\n\nWhiteboards containing Restricted and/or Sensitive information should be erased.\n\nTreat mass storage devices such as external hard drives or USB drives as sensitive and always secure and encrypt them.\n\nAll printers and fax machines should be cleared of papers as soon as they are printed; this helps ensure that sensitive documents are not left in printer trays for the wrong person to pick up.\n\nInternet/Intranet Access and Use\n\nUse of Codesphere computers, networks, and Internet access is a privilege granted by management and may be revoked at any time for inappropriate conduct carried out on such systems, including, but not limited to:\n\nSending chain letters or participating in any way in the creation or transmission of unsolicited \"spam\" that is unrelated to legitimate Company purposes;\n\nEngaging in private or personal business activities, including excessive use of instant messaging and chat rooms;\n\nAccessing networks, servers, drives, folders, or files to which the employee has not been granted access or authorization from someone with the right to make such a grant;\n\nMaking unauthorized copies of Company files or other Company data;\n\nDestroying, deleting, erasing, or concealing Company files or other Company data, or otherwise making such files or data unavailable or inaccessible to the Company or to other authorized users of Company systems;\n\nMisrepresenting oneself or the Company;\n\nViolating the laws and regulations of federal, state, city, province, or local jurisdictions in any way;\n\nEngaging in unlawful or malicious activities;\n\nDeliberately propagating any virus, worm, Trojan horse, trap-door program code, or other code or file designed to disrupt, disable, impair, or otherwise harm either the Company's networks or systems or those of any other individual or entity;\n\nUsing abusive, profane, threatening, racist, sexist, or otherwise objectionable language in either public or private messages;\n\nSending, receiving, or accessing pornographic materials;\n\nCausing congestion, disruption, disablement, alteration, or impairment of Company networks or systems;\n\nUsing recreational games; and/or\n\nDefeating or attempting to defeat security restrictions on company systems and applications.\n\nSuch access will be discontinued upon termination of employment, completion of contract, end of service of non-employee, or disciplinary action arising from violation of this policy. In the case of a change in job function and/or transfer, the original access code will be discontinued, and only reissued if necessary and a new request for access is approved.\n\nAll user IDs that have been inactive for thirty (30) days will be revoked. The privileges granted to users must be reevaluated by management annually. In response to feedback from management, systems administrators must promptly revoke all privileges no longer needed by users.\n\nTeleworking\n\nRequirements\n\nSecure remote access must be strictly controlled with encryption (i.e., Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)) and strong pass-phrases. Refer to the Encryption Policy and the Password Policy for further information.\n\nAuthorized Users must protect their login and password, without exception.\n\nWhile using a Codesphere-owned computer to remotely connect to the company''s network, authorized users must ensure the remote host is not connected to any other network at the same time, with the exception of personal networks that are under their complete control or under the complete control of an authorized user or third party.\n\nThe most up-to-date antivirus software must be used on all computers. Third party connections must comply with requirements as stated in the Vendor Management Agreement.\n\nEquipment used to connect to Codesphere's networks must meet the requirements for remote access and device use as stated in the Acceptable Use Policy, Asset Management Policy, and System Access Control Policy.\n\nRemote Access Tools\n\nAll remote access tools used to communicate between Codesphere assets and other systems must comply with the following policy requirements:\n\nMulti-factor authentication (such as authentication tokens and smart cards that require an additional PIN or password) is required for all remote access tools\n\nThe authentication database source must be Active Directory or LDAP, and the authentication protocol must involve a challenge-response protocol that is not susceptible to replay attacks. The remote access tool must mutually authenticate both ends of the session.\n\nRemote access tools must support the Codesphere application layer proxy rather than direct connections through the perimeter firewall(s).\n\nRemote access tools must support strong, end-to-end encryption of the remote access communication channels as specified in the Encryption Policy.\n\nAll antivirus, data loss prevention, and other security systems must not be disabled, interfered with, or circumvented in any way.\n\nMobile Endpoint and Storage Devices\n\nProtecting endpoint devices issued by Codesphere or storing company data is the responsibility of every employee. This pertains to all devices that connect to the company network, regardless of ownership. Mobile endpoint and storage devices are defined to include: desktop systems (in telework environment), laptops, PDAs, mobile phones, plug-ins, Universal Serial Bus (USB) port devices, Compact Discs (CDs), Digital Versatile Discs (DVDs), flash drives, modems, handheld wireless devices, wireless networking cards, and any other existing or future mobile computing or storage device, either personally owned or Codesphere owned. An inventory of company-owned assets will be properly maintained.\n\nFor endpoint devices,\n\nCompany-issued mobile devices will have antivirus and endpoint security pre-installed.\n\nUsers must run an online malware scanner at least once a month.\n\nIf browser add-ons are approved and installed, a browser testing tool shall be ran to ensure the security of the add-on.\n\nMobile endpoint devices must further meet the requirements for use as stated in the Acceptable Use Policy and Asset Management Policy.\n\nFor storage devices,\n\nA risk analysis will be conducted prior to the use or connection to the company network, unless previously approved.\n\nDetection of incidents must immediately be reported to the [RESPONSIBLE PARTY, e.g., information security team].\n\nStolen mobile devices must immediately be reported to the [RESPONSIBLE PARTY, e.g., information security team].\n\nIntellectual Property Rights\n\nCodesphere takes handling and safeguarding of intellectual property very seriously. Intellectual property rights include software or document copyright, design rights, trademarks, patents and source code licenses.\n\nTo ensure this the following procedures will be maintained:\n\nSoftware will only be acquired through known and reputable sources, to ensure that copyright is not violated.\n\nAn asset inventory will identify all assets with requirements to protect intellectual property rights.\n\nProof and evidence of ownership of licenses, master disks, manuals, etc. will be maintained.\n\nReview of the asset inventory will also make sure that only software and licensed products are installed.\n\nWill ensure compliance with terms and conditions for software and information obtained from public networks\n\nCloud Service Customers\n\nWhen using cloud services, additional procedures will be in place to identify any licensing requirements specific to cloud deployment. This is crucial as installing commercially licensed software in a cloud service may inadvertently breach the terms of the software license. This procedure will give particular attention to scenarios where the cloud service features are elastic and scalable, which may result in the software being used on more systems or processor cores than is permitted by the license terms.\n\nCloud Service Providers\n\nCodesphere will have an established process for responding to intellectual property rights complaints, ensuring the protection of proprietary assets.\n\nInformation Security Requirements Analysis & Specifications\n\nCodesphere will identify its information security requirements through utilizing different methods, ensure the results of the identification are documented and reviewed by all stakeholders, and will integrate the requirements and associated processes in early stages of projects.\n\nMethods\n\nPolicies and regulations\n\nThreat modeling\n\nIncident reviews\n\nUse of vulnerability thresholds\n\nFactors\n\nLevel of confidence required towards the claimed identity of users, in order to derive user authentication requirements.\n\nAccess provisioning and authorization processes, for business and privileged or technical users.\n\nInforming users and operators of their duties and responsibilities.\n\nProtection needs of assets, especially in terms of availability, confidentiality, integrity.\n\nBusiness processes (e.g., transaction logging and monitoring, non-repudiation requirements).\n\nOther security controls (e.g. interfaces to logging and monitoring or data leakage detection systems).\n\nEmployment Terms and Conditions\n\nThe following terms and conditions of employment at Codesphere are the contractual obligations for employees or contractors for the safeguarding of information. They include, but are not limited to:\n\nSigning a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement (NDA) prior to access to confidential information and processing facilities.\n\nLegal responsibilities and rights, particularly concerning intellectual property.\n\nResponsibilities for the classification of information and management of organizational assets associated with information, information processing facilities and information services handled by an employee or contractor.\n\nResponsibilities for handling of information received from third parties.\n\nReviewing and agreeing with the security policies of the company.\n\nDuration of responsibilities beyond end of employment.\n\nActions to be taken for non-compliance with the terms and conditions, and the company's security policies.\n\nDisciplinary Process\n\nCodesphere's discipline policy and procedures are designed to provide a structured corrective action process to improve and prevent a recurrence of undesirable employee behavior and performance issues. It has been designed to be consistent with Codesphere cultural values, Human Resources (HR) best practices, and employment laws.\n\nCodesphere reserves the right to combine or skip steps depending on the facts of each situation and the nature of the offense. The level of disciplinary intervention may also vary. Some of the factors that will be considered are whether the offense is repeated despite coaching, counseling, or training, the employee's work record, and the impact the conduct and performance issues have on the organization.\n\nStep 1: Verbal Warning and Counseling\n\nThis initial step creates an opportunity for the immediate supervisor to schedule a meeting with an employee to bring attention to an existing performance, conduct or attendance issue. The supervisor should discuss with the employee the nature of the problem or the violation of company policies and procedures. The supervisor is expected to clearly describe expectations and the steps the employee must take to improve performance or resolve the problem.\n\nStep 2: Formal Written Warning\n\nIf the employee does not promptly correct any performance, conduct or attendance issues that were identified in Step 1, a written warning will become formal documentation of the performance, conduct, or attendance issues and consequences. The employee will sign a copy of the document to acknowledge receipt and understanding of the formal warning. During Step 2, the immediate supervisor and HR representative will meet with the employee to review any additional incidents or information about the performance, conduct or attendance issues as well as any prior relevant corrective action plans. Management will outline the consequences for the employee of his or her continued failure to meet performance or conduct expectations.\n\nA formal performance improvement plan (PIP) requiring the employee's immediate and sustained corrective action will be issued after a Step 2 meeting. A warning outlining that the employee may be subject to additional discipline up to and including termination if immediate and sustained corrective action is not taken may also be included in the written warning.\n\nStep 3: Suspension and Final Written Warning\n\nThere may be performance, conduct, or safety incidents so problematic and harmful that the most effective action may be the temporary removal of the employee from the workplace. When immediate action is necessary to ensure the safety of the employee or others, the immediate supervisor may suspend the employee pending the results of an investigation. Suspensions that are recommended as part of the normal progression of this progressive discipline policy and procedure are subject to approval from a next-level manager and HR.\n\nStep 4: Recommendation for Termination of Employment\n\nThe last step in the progressive discipline procedure is a recommendation to terminate employment. Generally, Codesphere will try to exercise the progressive nature of this policy by first providing warnings, a final written warning or suspension from the workplace before proceeding to a recommendation to terminate employment. However, Codesphere reserves the right to combine and skip steps depending on the circumstances of each situation and the nature of the offense. Furthermore, employees may be terminated without prior notice or disciplinary action.\n\nManagement's recommendation to terminate employment must be approved by HR and the supervisor's immediate manager. Final approval may be required from the CEO.\n\nPerformance and Conduct Issues Not Subject to Progressive Discipline\n\nBehavior that is illegal is not subject to progressive discipline, and such behavior may be reported to local law enforcement authorities. Theft, substance abuse, intoxication, fighting and other acts of violence at work are grounds for immediate termination.\n\nEnforcement\n\nCodesphere Management, under the explicit authority granted by the company CEO, retains the authority and responsibility to monitor and enforce compliance with this Policy and other policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines. Monitoring activities may be conducted on an on-going basis or on a random basis whenever deemed necessary by Management and may require investigating the use of the Company's information resources. The company reserves the right to review any and all communications and activities without notice.\n\nCodesphere will take appropriate precautions to ensure that monitoring activities are limited to the extent necessary to determine whether the communications or activities are in violation of Company policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines or in accordance with normal business processing performance or quality activities.\n\nViolation of the controls established in this Policy is prohibited and will be appropriately addressed. Disciplinary actions for violations may include verbal and/or written warnings, suspension, termination, and/or other legal remedies and will be consistent with our published HR standards and practices.\n\nCloud Computing\n\nCloud Service Customers\n\nCodesphere will take the following into account for information security in cloud computing:\n\nInformation stored in its cloud computing environment may be accessed and managed by cloud service providers.\n\nAssets, such as application programs, could be maintained within the cloud computing environment.\n\nProcesses may run on multi-tenant, virtualized cloud service platforms.\n\nSpecific context of cloud service users and the circumstances surrounding the usage of the cloud service.\n\nAdministrators who have privileged access to the cloud service.\n\nGeographical locations of the cloud service provider's organization and where customer data might be stored, even temporarily.\n\nCloud Service Providers\n\nCodesphere will address the provision and use of its cloud services, taking the following into account:\n\nBaseline information security requirements during the design and implementation of cloud services.\n\nMitigation of risks associated with authorized insiders.\n\nMulti-tenancy and cloud service customer isolation, including robust virtualization measures.\n\nAccess controls for staff accessing its cloud service customer assets, including strong authentication mechanisms.\n\nEffective communication channels with its cloud service customers during change management processes.\n\nDeployment of robust virtualization security measures.\n\nAccess control for the protection of cloud service customer data.\n\nLifecycle management of cloud service customer accounts.\n\nCommunication of security breaches to cloud service customers and providing guidelines and support for investigations and forensics to ensure effective incident response and remediation.\n\n \n\nRevision History\n\nVersion\n\nDate\n\nEditor\n\nApprover\n\nDescription of Changes\n\nFormat\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\n  \"result\": \"Valid\",\n  \"problems\": [\n    {\n      \"control\": \"A.5.1\",\n      \"issue\": \"s\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"control\": \"A.5.2\",\n      \"issue\": \"das\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}]}
