This data requires the highest level of protection due to its potential impact on the company \nand its customers if disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization.\nInternal Data: All data owned or licensed by the company. This data is intended for use within the organization and must be protected \nfrom unauthorized access, but it does not carry the same level of risk as Confidential/Restricted Data.\nPublic Information: Any information that is available within the public domain. This data has no existing local, national, or international \nlegal restrictions on access or usage and poses minimal risk to the company if disclosed or altered.\n\nThese definitions ensure a common understanding of data types and their respective sensitivity levels, which is crucial for implementing \nappropriate security measures and maintaining compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.\n3.1.2 Working Instructions\nThis working instruction is based on the guideline on the organization's assets and the classification scheme described therein.\nClassification Specification: The owner (editor) of the information should specify appropriate classification at the time of its creation.\nLabeling Responsibility: The author is responsible for the correct labeling of information.\nPeriodic Review: Where applicable, the owner should check periodically whether the information is still needed, and the classification is \nstill justified.\nAdoption of Existing Classifications: If an item of information has already been classified by another entity or a specific classification \nis required contractually, that classification must be adopted.\nPrinted Information Marking: Printed classified information shall be marked accordingly. The classification note \"internal use\" or \n\"confidential\" shall be placed on the title page and/or in the footer of the document.\nElectronic Information Tagging: Electronic information and data should be tagged with the available metadata.\nDevice Labeling: In order to keep the administrative effort within manageable limits, the devices carrying data are not labeled. \nEmployees are instructed to treat such devices and mobile devices as if they contained classified information.\nAccess Control: Access to information categorized as \"confidential\" is given on a \"need-to-know\" basis, i.e., an individual only receives \naccess to such information to the extent necessary for the performance of his or her work. Information categorized as \"internal use\" \nshould be available to employees by default.\nPrivileged Users: Classified information is only made available to privileged users. In the case of electronically stored information, \nappropriate authorizations must be assigned.\nSecurity of Devices: Devices carrying data and devices on which classified information is stored shall be kept securely locked or \npassword protected (e.g., employee laptops should not be locked, but should be password protected).\nData Deletion: If classified information on data carriers and devices is to be deleted, it should be done in line Asset Management Poli\ncy | 3.13 Disposal of Media and Devices and lead to the permanent destruction of such information.\nDefault Classification: Documents without a label should by default be treated as \"Internal Use\" unless they are marketing or sales \nmaterials or materials intended to be available publicly or for selected external parties (which should be verified with the document \nowner).\nThese generic requirements ensure that information is classified, labeled, reviewed, and protected appropriately, maintaining the security \nand integrity of the company's data throughout its lifecycle.\n3.2 Data Classification Scheme\nData classification, in the context of information security, is the classification of data based on its level of sensitivity and the impact to the \ncompany should that data be disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization. The classification of data helps determine what baseline \nsecurity controls are appropriate for safeguarding that data. All data should be classified into one of the following classifications:\n3.2.1 Confidential/Restricted Data\nData should be classified as Confidential/Restricted when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data could cause a \nserious or significant level of risk to the company or its customers. Examples of sensitive data include data protected by state or federal \nprivacy regulations (e.g., PHI & PII) and data protected by confidentiality agreements. The highest level of security controls should be \napplied to Confidential/Restricted Data:\nAccess Restrictions: Disclosure or access to Confidential/Restricted data is limited to specific use by individuals with a legitimate need-\nto-know. Explicit authorization by the CISO is required for access due to legal, contractual, privacy, or other constraints.\nProtection Measures: Must be protected to prevent loss, theft, unauthorized access, and/or unauthorized disclosure.\nData Destruction: Must be destroyed when no longer needed. Destruction must be in accordance with company policies and \nprocedures.\n\nIncident Response: Will require specific methodologies, procedures, and reporting requirements for the response and handling of \nincidents.\n3.2.2 Internal Use Data\nData should be classified as Internal Use when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data could result in a moderate \nlevel of risk to the company or its customers. This includes proprietary, ethical, or privacy considerations. Data must be protected from \nunauthorized access, modification, transmission, storage, or other use. This applies even though there may not be a civil statute requiring \nthis protection. Internal Use Data is restricted to personnel who have a legitimate reason to access it. By default, all data that is not explicitly \nclassified as Confidential/Restricted or Public data should be treated as Internal Use data. A reasonable level of security controls should be \napplied to Internal Use Data.\n3.2.3 Public Data\nData should be classified as Public when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data would result in little or no risk to \nthe company and its customers. It is further defined as information with no existing local, national, or international legal restrictions on \naccess or usage. While little or no controls are required to protect the confidentiality of Public data, some level of control is required to \nprevent unauthorized alteration or destruction of Public Data.\n3.2.4 De-identified Data\nThe company will de-identify data as a tool to remove personal information from data that it collects, uses, archives, and shares with other \norganizations. The de-identification process will allow the removal of direct identifiers, including all unique identifying numbers, \ncharacteristics, or codes. If a data set contains any amount or type of personal information, it will not be considered de-identified.\nThis data classification scheme ensures that all data handled by the company is appropriately classified based on its sensitivity and \npotential impact. By assigning one of the defined classifications, the company can implement suitable security controls to protect the data, \nthereby maintaining data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n3.3 Assessing Classification Level and Labeling\nThe goal of information security, as stated in the Information Security Policy, is to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of \nCorporate and Customer Data. Data classification reflects the level of impact to the company if confidentiality, integrity, or availability is \ncompromised.\n3.3.1 Classification Guidance\nIf a classification is not inherently obvious, consider each security objective using the following table as a guide. All data will be assigned one \nof the following four sensitivity levels:\n4 - \nRESTRICTE\nD (Critical)\nHighly \nsensitive \ninformation.\nDictated \nexternally by legal \nand/or contractual \nrequirements.\nMust be limited to \nonly authorized \nemployees, \ncontractors, and \nbusiness partners \nwith a specific \nbusiness need.\nSeriousImpact could \ninclude negatively \naffecting the \ncompany's \ncompetitive \nposition, violating \nregulatory \nrequirements, \ndamaging the \ncompany's \nPHI, sensitive PII, \nconfidential \nagreements\nClassificati\non\nDescriptionProtectionAccessDamageImpactExamples\n\nLegend:\nClassification: The level of sensitivity assigned to the data.\nDescription: An overview of the type of information and its sensitivity.\nProtection: The required level of protection based on legal, contractual, or internal policies.\nAccess: Who is allowed to access the data and under what conditions.\nDamage: The level of damage which would occur information were to become available to unauthorized parties.\nImpact: The potential consequences if the data were to be disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization.\nExamples: Typical examples of data that fall under each classification level.\n3.3.2 Labeling\nData must be labeled according to its classification to ensure proper handling. Labels should be clear and indicate the level of sensitivity. For \nexample:\nRestricted: \"CONFIDENTIAL/RESTRICTED\"\nConfidential: \"CONFIDENTIAL\"\nInternal Use: \"INTERNAL USE ONLY\"\nPublic: No specific label required\nreputation, violating \ncontractual \nrequirements, and \nposing an identity \ntheft risk.\n3 - \nCONFIDENT\nIAL (High)\nSensitive \ninformation.\nDictated internally \nby the company.\nMust be limited to \nonly authorized \nemployees, \ncontractors, and \nbusiness partners \nwith a specific \nbusiness need.\nSignificantImpact could \ninclude negatively \naffecting the \ncompany's \ncompetitive \nposition, damaging \nthe company's \nreputation, violating \ncontractual \nrequirements, and \nexposing the \ngeographic location \nof individuals.\nInternal memos, \nproprietary \nbusiness \ninformation, \ngeneral PII\n2 - \nINTERNAL \nUSE \n(Medium)\nNon-sensitive \ninformation.\nOriginating within \nor owned by the \ncompany, or \nentrusted to it by \nothers.\nMay be shared \nwith authorized \nemployees, \ncontractors, and \nbusiness partners \nwho have a \nbusiness need.\nModerateImpact could \ninclude damaging \nthe company's \nreputation and \nviolating contractual \nrequirements.\nInternal emails, \nproject documents\n1 - PUBLIC \n(Low)\nInformation \nthat has been \napproved for \nrelease to the \ngeneral public.\nFreely shareable \nboth internally and \nexternally.\nNo specific access \nrestrictions.\nNo damageImpact would not be \ndamaging or a risk \nto business \noperations.\nPress releases, \nmarketing \nmaterials\n\n3.3.3 Cloud Computing Environment\nWhen maintaining information and associated assets in the cloud computing environment, the cloud service customer is expected to label \nthese assets following the company's defined procedures for labeling. This may include the utilization of labeling functionalities provided by \nthe cloud service provider, where relevant. The cloud service provider is obliged to document and reveal any service functionality it offers, \nenabling the company to classify and label their information and associated assets.\nProper classification and labeling are crucial for maintaining the security of data. By categorizing data based on its sensitivity and applying \nappropriate labels, the company can ensure that data is handled correctly and securely, both within the organization and in cloud \nenvironments. This process helps protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of corporate and customer data.\n3.4 Handling Controls\nThe following handling controls are designed to ensure that data is protected according to its classification level. These controls outline the \nspecific requirements for various methods of data transmission, storage, and access to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability \nof the company's information. Each classification level requires different controls to address the potential impact of unauthorized access or \ndisclosure.\n4 - \nRESTRICTE\nD (Critical)\nRequired \nprior to \naccess by \nnon-\ncompany \nemployees \nEncryption \nRequired\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited \nEncryption \nRequired\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited\nRemote Access if \nNecessary (only \nwith VPN and \ntwo-factor \nauthorization \nwhen possible) \nEncryption \nRequired\nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nUse)\nPhysical \nAccess \nRestricted to \nSpecific \nIndividuals \nEncryption \nRequired\nRemote Wipe \nEnablement \nRequired, if \npossible \nEncryption \nRequired\nDo Not \nForward \nMark \"Open by \nAddressee \nOnly\"\nUse Courier or \n\"Certified Mail\" \nand Sealed, \nTamper-\nResistant \nEnvelopes for \nExternal \nMailings \n3 - \nCONFIDEN\nTIAL (High)\nRequired \nprior to \naccess by \nnon-\ncompany \nemployees \nEncryption \nRecommende\nd\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited \nEncryption \nRequired\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited\nRemote Access if \nNecessary (only \nEncryption \nRecommended\nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nUse)\nPhysical \nAccess \nRestricted to \nSpecific groups \nEncryption \nRequired\nRemote Wipe \nEnablement \nRequired, if \npossible \nEncryption \nRequired\nDo not \nForward \nMark \"Open by \nAddressee \nOnly\"\nUse \"Certified \nMail\" and \nSealed, \nTamper-\nResistant \nEnvelopes for \nExternal \nMailings \nClassificati\non / \nHandling \nControls\nNon-\nDisclosur\ne \nAgreemen\nt (NDA)\nInternal \nNetwork \nTransmissio\nn\nExternal \nNetwork \nTransmission\nData at RestMobile \nDevices\nEmailPhysical Mail\n\nLegend:\nClassification: The level of sensitivity assigned to the data.\nHandling Controls: Specifies the required security measures for handling data at different classification levels.\nNon-Disclosure Agreement (NDA): Indicates whether an NDA is required before granting access.\nInternal Network Transmission: Requirements for transmitting data over internal networks (wired & wireless).\nExternal Network Transmission: Requirements for transmitting data over external networks (wired & wireless).\nData at Rest: Requirements for storing data on file servers, databases, archives, etc.\nMobile Devices: Requirements for handling data on mobile devices (iPhone, iPad, USB Drive, etc.).\nEmail: Requirements for sending data via email (with and without attachments).\nPhysical Mail: Requirements for sending data via physical mail.\nwith VPN and \ntwo-factor \nauthorization \nwhen possible)\n2 - \nINTERNAL \nUSE \n(Medium)\nNot \nRequired \nNo \nRequirements \nEncryption \nRecommended\nInstant \nMessaging \nAllowed \n(Corporate Only)\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited \nEncryption \nRecommended\nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nUse)\nPhysical \nAccess \nRestricted to \nSpecific groups \nEncryption \nRecommended\nRemote Wipe \nEnablement \nRecommended\n, if possible \nExercising due \ncare\nNo \nRequirements \n1 - PUBLIC \n(Low)\nNot \nRequired \nNo \nRequirements \nNo special \nrequirements \nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nModification \nOnly)\nPhysical \nAccess \nUnrestricted \n(Unauthorized \nModification \nControls \nrecommended)\nNo \nRequirements \nNo \nRequirements \nUS Mail or \nOther Public \nDelivery \nSystems \n4 - \nRESTRICTE\nD (Critical)\nMay only be \naccessible to \nauthorized \npersons.\nExercisin\ng due \ncare\nForbiddenForbiddenOnly with the \nconsent of the \nauthor.\nExercising \ndue care\nPrinting must \nbe personally \nsupervised to \nprevent \nData carriers \nmust be \nhanded over \nto the IT \nClassificati\non / \nHandling \nControls\nPaperPhoneConversati\nons\nFaxChangeCopyPrintDestroy\n\nLegend:\nPaper: Requirements for storing and handling physical paper documents.\nPhone: Requirements for exchanging information over the phone.\nConversations: Guidelines for discussing information in public areas.\nFax: Requirements for sending information via fax.\nChange: Guidelines for changing information.\nCopy: Guidelines for copying information.\nPrint: Guidelines for printing information.\nDestroy: Guidelines for destroying information.\n3.5 Integrity\nIntegrity refers to ensuring the correctness (integrity) of data and the correct functioning of systems.

Responsibilities include:\nData Sanitization: Ensure that data is securely wiped from assets before disposal or repurposing, based on its classification.\nAccess Control Implementation: Apply and manage access controls in accordance with data classification levels.\nTechnical Configuration: Implement baseline security configurations tailored to the classification of the data.\n2.6 End Users\nEnd Users are responsible for adhering to the Data Classification Policy. Responsibilities include:\nAdherence to Classification Guidelines: Handle data according to its classification, following prescribed guidelines.\nReporting Incidents: Report any breaches or mishandling of data classification to the IT department immediately.\nLabeling and Handling: Properly label and handle data as per the classification guidelines to prevent unauthorized access or exposure.\n3 Policy\n3.1 General Approach\n3.1.1 Definitions\nThe following definitions provide clarity on the types of data covered under this policy and the levels of sensitivity assigned to each category. \nThese definitions are essential for understanding the data classification scheme and the corresponding handling requirements.\nConfidential/Restricted Data: Generalized terms that typically represent data classified as Sensitive or Private, according to the data \nclassification scheme defined in this policy. This data requires the highest level of protection due to its potential impact on the company \nand its customers if disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization.\nInternal Data: All data owned or licensed by the company. This data is intended for use within the organization and must be protected \nfrom unauthorized access, but it does not carry the same level of risk as Confidential/Restricted Data.\nPublic Information: Any information that is available within the public domain. This data has no existing local, national, or international \nlegal restrictions on access or usage and poses minimal risk to the company if disclosed or altered.\n\nThese definitions ensure a common understanding of data types and their respective sensitivity levels, which is crucial for implementing \nappropriate security measures and maintaining compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.\n3.1.2 Working Instructions\nThis working instruction is based on the guideline on the organization's assets and the classification scheme described therein.\nClassification Specification: The owner (editor) of the information should specify appropriate classification at the time of its creation.\nLabeling Responsibility: The author is responsible for the correct labeling of information.\nPeriodic Review: Where applicable, the owner should check periodically whether the information is still needed, and the classification is \nstill justified.\nAdoption of Existing Classifications: If an item of information has already been classified by another entity or a specific classification \nis required contractually, that classification must be adopted.\nPrinted Information Marking: Printed classified information shall be marked accordingly. The classification note \"internal use\" or \n\"confidential\" shall be placed on the title page and/or in the footer of the document.\nElectronic Information Tagging: Electronic information and data should be tagged with the available metadata.\nDevice Labeling: In order to keep the administrative effort within manageable limits, the devices carrying data are not labeled. \nEmployees are instructed to treat such devices and mobile devices as if they contained classified information.\nAccess Control: Access to information categorized as \"confidential\" is given on a \"need-to-know\" basis, i.e., an individual only receives \naccess to such information to the extent necessary for the performance of his or her work. Information categorized as \"internal use\" \nshould be available to employees by default.\nPrivileged Users: Classified information is only made available to privileged users. In the case of electronically stored information, \nappropriate authorizations must be assigned.\nSecurity of Devices: Devices carrying data and devices on which classified information is stored shall be kept securely locked or \npassword protected (e.g., employee laptops should not be locked, but should be password protected).\nData Deletion: If classified information on data carriers and devices is to be deleted, it should be done in line Asset Management Poli\ncy | 3.13 Disposal of Media and Devices and lead to the permanent destruction of such information.\nDefault Classification: Documents without a label should by default be treated as \"Internal Use\" unless they are marketing or sales \nmaterials or materials intended to be available publicly or for selected external parties (which should be verified with the document \nowner).\nThese generic requirements ensure that information is classified, labeled, reviewed, and protected appropriately, maintaining the security \nand integrity of the company's data throughout its lifecycle.\n3.2 Data Classification Scheme\nData classification, in the context of information security, is the classification of data based on its level of sensitivity and the impact to the \ncompany should that data be disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization. The classification of data helps determine what baseline \nsecurity controls are appropriate for safeguarding that data. All data should be classified into one of the following classifications:\n3.2.1 Confidential/Restricted Data\nData should be classified as Confidential/Restricted when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data could cause a \nserious or significant level of risk to the company or its customers. Examples of sensitive data include data protected by state or federal \nprivacy regulations (e.g., PHI & PII) and data protected by confidentiality agreements. The highest level of security controls should be \napplied to Confidential/Restricted Data:\nAccess Restrictions: Disclosure or access to Confidential/Restricted data is limited to specific use by individuals with a legitimate need-\nto-know. Explicit authorization by the CISO is required for access due to legal, contractual, privacy, or other constraints.\nProtection Measures: Must be protected to prevent loss, theft, unauthorized access, and/or unauthorized disclosure.\nData Destruction: Must be destroyed when no longer needed. Destruction must be in accordance with company policies and \nprocedures.\n\nIncident Response: Will require specific methodologies, procedures, and reporting requirements for the response and handling of \nincidents.\n3.2.2 Internal Use Data\nData should be classified as Internal Use when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data could result in a moderate \nlevel of risk to the company or its customers. This includes proprietary, ethical, or privacy considerations. Data must be protected from \nunauthorized access, modification, transmission, storage, or other use. This applies even though there may not be a civil statute requiring \nthis protection. Internal Use Data is restricted to personnel who have a legitimate reason to access it. By default, all data that is not explicitly \nclassified as Confidential/Restricted or Public data should be treated as Internal Use data. A reasonable level of security controls should be \napplied to Internal Use Data.\n3.2.3 Public Data\nData should be classified as Public when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data would result in little or no risk to \nthe company and its customers. It is further defined as information with no existing local, national, or international legal restrictions on \naccess or usage. While little or no controls are required to protect the confidentiality of Public data, some level of control is required to \nprevent unauthorized alteration or destruction of Public Data.\n3.2.4 De-identified Data\nThe company will de-identify data as a tool to remove personal information from data that it collects, uses, archives, and shares with other \norganizations. The de-identification process will allow the removal of direct identifiers, including all unique identifying numbers, \ncharacteristics, or codes. If a data set contains any amount or type of personal information, it will not be considered de-identified.\nThis data classification scheme ensures that all data handled by the company is appropriately classified based on its sensitivity and \npotential impact. By assigning one of the defined classifications, the company can implement suitable security controls to protect the data, \nthereby maintaining data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n3.3 Assessing Classification Level and Labeling\nThe goal of information security, as stated in the Information Security Policy, is to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of \nCorporate and Customer Data. Data classification reflects the level of impact to the company if confidentiality, integrity, or availability is \ncompromised.\n3.3.1 Classification Guidance\nIf a classification is not inherently obvious, consider each security objective using the following table as a guide. All data will be assigned one \nof the following four sensitivity levels:\n4 - \nRESTRICTE\nD (Critical)\nHighly \nsensitive \ninformation.\nDictated \nexternally by legal \nand/or contractual \nrequirements.\nMust be limited to \nonly authorized \nemployees, \ncontractors, and \nbusiness partners \nwith a specific \nbusiness need.\nSeriousImpact could \ninclude negatively \naffecting the \ncompany's \ncompetitive \nposition, violating \nregulatory \nrequirements, \ndamaging the \ncompany's \nPHI, sensitive PII, \nconfidential \nagreements\nClassificati\non\nDescriptionProtectionAccessDamageImpactExamples\n\nLegend:\nClassification: The level of sensitivity assigned to the data.\nDescription: An overview of the type of information and its sensitivity.\nProtection: The required level of protection based on legal, contractual, or internal policies.\nAccess: Who is allowed to access the data and under what conditions.\nDamage: The level of damage which would occur information were to become available to unauthorized parties.\nImpact: The potential consequences if the data were to be disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization.\nExamples: Typical examples of data that fall under each classification level.\n3.3.2 Labeling\nData must be labeled according to its classification to ensure proper handling. Labels should be clear and indicate the level of sensitivity.

This may include the utilization of labeling functionalities provided by \nthe cloud service provider, where relevant. The cloud service provider is obliged to document and reveal any service functionality it offers, \nenabling the company to classify and label their information and associated assets.\nProper classification and labeling are crucial for maintaining the security of data. By categorizing data based on its sensitivity and applying \nappropriate labels, the company can ensure that data is handled correctly and securely, both within the organization and in cloud \nenvironments. This process helps protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of corporate and customer data.\n3.4 Handling Controls\nThe following handling controls are designed to ensure that data is protected according to its classification level. These controls outline the \nspecific requirements for various methods of data transmission, storage, and access to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability \nof the company's information. Each classification level requires different controls to address the potential impact of unauthorized access or \ndisclosure.\n4 - \nRESTRICTE\nD (Critical)\nRequired \nprior to \naccess by \nnon-\ncompany \nemployees \nEncryption \nRequired\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited \nEncryption \nRequired\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited\nRemote Access if \nNecessary (only \nwith VPN and \ntwo-factor \nauthorization \nwhen possible) \nEncryption \nRequired\nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nUse)\nPhysical \nAccess \nRestricted to \nSpecific \nIndividuals \nEncryption \nRequired\nRemote Wipe \nEnablement \nRequired, if \npossible \nEncryption \nRequired\nDo Not \nForward \nMark \"Open by \nAddressee \nOnly\"\nUse Courier or \n\"Certified Mail\" \nand Sealed, \nTamper-\nResistant \nEnvelopes for \nExternal \nMailings \n3 - \nCONFIDEN\nTIAL (High)\nRequired \nprior to \naccess by \nnon-\ncompany \nemployees \nEncryption \nRecommende\nd\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited \nEncryption \nRequired\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited\nRemote Access if \nNecessary (only \nEncryption \nRecommended\nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nUse)\nPhysical \nAccess \nRestricted to \nSpecific groups \nEncryption \nRequired\nRemote Wipe \nEnablement \nRequired, if \npossible \nEncryption \nRequired\nDo not \nForward \nMark \"Open by \nAddressee \nOnly\"\nUse \"Certified \nMail\" and \nSealed, \nTamper-\nResistant \nEnvelopes for \nExternal \nMailings \nClassificati\non / \nHandling \nControls\nNon-\nDisclosur\ne \nAgreemen\nt (NDA)\nInternal \nNetwork \nTransmissio\nn\nExternal \nNetwork \nTransmission\nData at RestMobile \nDevices\nEmailPhysical Mail\n\nLegend:\nClassification: The level of sensitivity assigned to the data.\nHandling Controls: Specifies the required security measures for handling data at different classification levels.\nNon-Disclosure Agreement (NDA): Indicates whether an NDA is required before granting access.\nInternal Network Transmission: Requirements for transmitting data over internal networks (wired & wireless).\nExternal Network Transmission: Requirements for transmitting data over external networks (wired & wireless).\nData at Rest: Requirements for storing data on file servers, databases, archives, etc.\nMobile Devices: Requirements for handling data on mobile devices (iPhone, iPad, USB Drive, etc.).\nEmail: Requirements for sending data via email (with and without attachments).\nPhysical Mail: Requirements for sending data via physical mail.\nwith VPN and \ntwo-factor \nauthorization \nwhen possible)\n2 - \nINTERNAL \nUSE \n(Medium)\nNot \nRequired \nNo \nRequirements \nEncryption \nRecommended\nInstant \nMessaging \nAllowed \n(Corporate Only)\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited \nEncryption \nRecommended\nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nUse)\nPhysical \nAccess \nRestricted to \nSpecific groups \nEncryption \nRecommended\nRemote Wipe \nEnablement \nRecommended\n, if possible \nExercising due \ncare\nNo \nRequirements \n1 - PUBLIC \n(Low)\nNot \nRequired \nNo \nRequirements \nNo special \nrequirements \nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nModification \nOnly)\nPhysical \nAccess \nUnrestricted \n(Unauthorized \nModification \nControls \nrecommended)\nNo \nRequirements \nNo \nRequirements \nUS Mail or \nOther Public \nDelivery \nSystems \n4 - \nRESTRICTE\nD (Critical)\nMay only be \naccessible to \nauthorized \npersons.\nExercisin\ng due \ncare\nForbiddenForbiddenOnly with the \nconsent of the \nauthor.\nExercising \ndue care\nPrinting must \nbe personally \nsupervised to \nprevent \nData carriers \nmust be \nhanded over \nto the IT \nClassificati\non / \nHandling \nControls\nPaperPhoneConversati\nons\nFaxChangeCopyPrintDestroy\n\nLegend:\nPaper: Requirements for storing and handling physical paper documents.\nPhone: Requirements for exchanging information over the phone.\nConversations: Guidelines for discussing information in public areas.\nFax: Requirements for sending information via fax.\nChange: Guidelines for changing information.\nCopy: Guidelines for copying information.\nPrint: Guidelines for printing information.\nDestroy: Guidelines for destroying information.\n3.5 Integrity\nIntegrity refers to ensuring the correctness (integrity) of data and the correct functioning of systems.

facilities, infrastructure, and sensitive data based on a risk-\nbased approach and implemented where feasible. \nAccess Restriction: Physical access to the company's secure facilities, such as server rooms and critical infrastructure, is restricted to \nauthorized personnel only. In remote locations, employees are responsible for securing access to company resources through digital \nmeans, such as VPNs and secure login systems.\nEmployee Identification: In secure controlled facilities, employees are required to wear identification badges to distinguish themselves \nas authorized personnel. In remote environments, this control may not be applicable but should be supplemented by other identity \nverification methods where necessary.\nVisitor Management: Visitors and vendors must be escorted by an authorized employee at all times while on company premises. Visitor \naccess may not be applicable in remote locations, but employees are required to ensure the confidentiality and security of any sensitive \ninformation.\nIncident Reporting: All workforce members are responsible for reporting unauthorized visitors or access attempts to company facilities \nor systems. This includes both physical locations and remote work environments. Reporting should be immediate to the Security Officer \nor Facility Manager.\nRecord-Keeping: It is recommended to retain a detailed record of each physical access, including visits, maintenance, and repairs \nwhere feasible.\nGiven the remote nature of many locations, physical controls will be implemented flexibly based on an assessment of the risks involved in \neach environment.\n3.2 Access Requirements\nPhysical access to secure facilities is managed through badge readers, smart locks, and physical keys. In environments where these \ncontrols are not applicable, such as coworking spaces, alternative security measures based on risk assessments will be applied.\nBadge and Key Management: Access to the company's badge and key systems is restricted to authorized personnel based on a need-\nto-know basis. Workforce members must report lost or stolen keys or badges immediately to their manager, and the Facility Manager \nmust re-provision access or change locks within 7 days.\nRestricted Areas: Secure areas, such as server rooms, must be locked when unattended, and access is granted only to authorized \nemployees. In remote or coworking environments, employees must ensure their devices and sensitive information are secured.\nVisitor Controls: Visitors must sign a log upon entering secure facilities, indicating the date, time, purpose, and point of contact. Visitor \nlogs must be kept for at least 3 months. In remote environments, visitor controls may not be applicable but should be replaced by strong \ndigital access controls.\nLoading and Delivery Areas: Access to loading and delivery areas is restricted to authorized personnel, and shipments should be \ninspected according to Asset Management procedures. In remote locations, this control may not be necessary but should be considered \nif the location handles sensitive assets.\n3.3 Maintenance and Monitoring\nContinuous monitoring and maintenance of physical security systems are crucial for protecting the company's assets. These requirements \napply primarily to formal company locations, while remote work environments may not require such stringent controls.\nMany of the company's operations take place either in its own offices or remotely, including at home, in cafes, or coworking spaces. \nThe company's own offices may also be considered as remote locations in certain contexts.\nAs a result, certain physical security controls, such as badge systems or visitor logs, may not be applicable to all environments. \nSecurity measures will be applied based on a risk-based approach and implemented where feasible. The specific controls \nimplemented will vary depending on the location and the nature of the activities being conducted there.\n\nMaintenance of Security Equipment: Any repairs or maintenance to physical security equipment, including locks, cameras, and access \ncontrol systems, must be documented, with records retained for at least seven years.\nCCTV Monitoring: Secure areas must be monitored by CCTV, with recordings stored for at least 3 months. For remote locations, \nemployees are responsible for ensuring security through digital means, such as monitoring login activity and using endpoint security \nmeasures.\nAlarm Systems: Alarm systems must be installed in critical areas and tested regularly. In remote work environments, employees should \nensure the security of their workspace, devices, and data through encryption and secure access controls.\n3.4 Workstation Security\nWorkstation security is essential to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive company data. In formal facilities, workstations are protected \nby physical and technical safeguards, while in remote locations, employees must follow strict digital security measures.\nAccess to Workstations: Only authorized employees may access company-owned workstations, and these devices must be used \nsolely for business purposes. Workstations must be locked or logged off when left unattended.\nPhysical Safeguards: In shared or open workspaces, workstations must be positioned to prevent unauthorized viewing of sensitive \ninformation. Employees should use privacy filters or position screens away from public view.\nPortable Device Security: Laptops and other portable devices containing sensitive information must be secured when left unattended, \nusing cable locks or locked storage. Employees in remote environments must also adhere to the company's Encryption Policy.\n3.5 Visitor and Vendor Management\nVisitor and vendor access to company facilities must be tightly controlled, though these measures may not be applicable in remote work \nenvironments.\nEscort Requirement: Visitors and vendors must be escorted by an authorized company employee while on the premises. Remote \nenvironments, such as cafes, may not have the need for physical escorts, but sensitive data must be protected.\nVisitor Badges: Visitors in formal company locations must wear badges that distinguish them from employees. These badges must be \nreturned when leaving the facility.\nVisitor Logs: Logs documenting visitor access, including date, time, and purpose, must be maintained for at least 3 months. In remote \nenvironments, visitor logs may not apply, but employees must ensure secure access to any shared devices or data.\n3.6 Data Center and Building Standards\nThe company does not maintain its own data centers and instead relies on cloud infrastructure providers such as AWS and Azure. However, \nany physical infrastructure under the company's control must adhere to high security standards.\nSecurity Perimeters: Secure perimeters must be established around areas containing critical data or infrastructure. Entry points should \nbe protected with access controls and monitored by surveillance cameras.\nCCTV Monitoring: Critical areas must be monitored by CCTV, and recordings must be kept for at least 3 months.\nBackup Power: Backup power supplies, such as UPS systems, must be available for critical infrastructure to ensure continuous \noperations during power outages.\nEmergency Power Shut-off: Emergency power shut-off switches must be located near exits in critical equipment rooms to allow for \nrapid shutdown during emergencies.\n3.7 Enforcement of Facility Access Policies\nTo ensure compliance with security policies, violations of these controls will result in investigation and potential disciplinary actions.\nIncident Reporting: Employees, visitors, and vendors must report any violations of physical security policies to their manager or the \nSecurity Officer immediately.\n\nDisciplinary Actions: Employees found violating these policies may face disciplinary actions, up to and including termination. Visitors \nand vendors may have their access privileges revoked.\nIn remote environments, security measures may be adapted based on risk assessments, but all employees are responsible for safeguarding \ncompany data and resources. Non-compliance will be investigated and addressed accordingly.\n4 Document Administration\n4.1 Ownership and Review\n  \n4.2 Monitoring and Enforcement\n4.3 Related Documents\n4.3.1 Internal documents\nInformation Security Policy \nInformation Security Organization Policy\n4.4 Approvals\n4.5 Revision History\nFollow the link for details of revisions. \nThe Document Owner owns this Document and is responsible for reviewing the Document for updates annually, or following any major \nchanges to Squirro AG's compliance environment.

facilities, infrastructure, and sensitive data based on a risk-\nbased approach and implemented where feasible. \nAccess Restriction: Physical access to the company's secure facilities, such as server rooms and critical infrastructure, is restricted to \nauthorized personnel only. In remote locations, employees are responsible for securing access to company resources through digital \nmeans, such as VPNs and secure login systems.\nEmployee Identification: In secure controlled facilities, employees are required to wear identification badges to distinguish themselves \nas authorized personnel. In remote environments, this control may not be applicable but should be supplemented by other identity \nverification methods where necessary.\nVisitor Management: Visitors and vendors must be escorted by an authorized employee at all times while on company premises. Visitor \naccess may not be applicable in remote locations, but employees are required to ensure the confidentiality and security of any sensitive \ninformation.\nIncident Reporting: All workforce members are responsible for reporting unauthorized visitors or access attempts to company facilities \nor systems. This includes both physical locations and remote work environments. Reporting should be immediate to the Security Officer \nor Facility Manager.\nRecord-Keeping: It is recommended to retain a detailed record of each physical access, including visits, maintenance, and repairs \nwhere feasible.\nGiven the remote nature of many locations, physical controls will be implemented flexibly based on an assessment of the risks involved in \neach environment.\n3.2 Access Requirements\nPhysical access to secure facilities is managed through badge readers, smart locks, and physical keys. In environments where these \ncontrols are not applicable, such as coworking spaces, alternative security measures based on risk assessments will be applied.\nBadge and Key Management: Access to the company's badge and key systems is restricted to authorized personnel based on a need-\nto-know basis. Workforce members must report lost or stolen keys or badges immediately to their manager, and the Facility Manager \nmust re-provision access or change locks within 7 days.\nRestricted Areas: Secure areas, such as server rooms, must be locked when unattended, and access is granted only to authorized \nemployees. In remote or coworking environments, employees must ensure their devices and sensitive information are secured.\nVisitor Controls: Visitors must sign a log upon entering secure facilities, indicating the date, time, purpose, and point of contact. Visitor \nlogs must be kept for at least 3 months. In remote environments, visitor controls may not be applicable but should be replaced by strong \ndigital access controls.\nLoading and Delivery Areas: Access to loading and delivery areas is restricted to authorized personnel, and shipments should be \ninspected according to Asset Management procedures. In remote locations, this control may not be necessary but should be considered \nif the location handles sensitive assets.\n3.3 Maintenance and Monitoring\nContinuous monitoring and maintenance of physical security systems are crucial for protecting the company's assets. These requirements \napply primarily to formal company locations, while remote work environments may not require such stringent controls.\nMany of the company's operations take place either in its own offices or remotely, including at home, in cafes, or coworking spaces. \nThe company's own offices may also be considered as remote locations in certain contexts.\nAs a result, certain physical security controls, such as badge systems or visitor logs, may not be applicable to all environments. \nSecurity measures will be applied based on a risk-based approach and implemented where feasible. The specific controls \nimplemented will vary depending on the location and the nature of the activities being conducted there.\n\nMaintenance of Security Equipment: Any repairs or maintenance to physical security equipment, including locks, cameras, and access \ncontrol systems, must be documented, with records retained for at least seven years.\nCCTV Monitoring: Secure areas must be monitored by CCTV, with recordings stored for at least 3 months.

facilities, infrastructure, and sensitive data based on a risk-\nbased approach and implemented where feasible. \nAccess Restriction: Physical access to the company's secure facilities, such as server rooms and critical infrastructure, is restricted to \nauthorized personnel only. In remote locations, employees are responsible for securing access to company resources through digital \nmeans, such as VPNs and secure login systems.\nEmployee Identification: In secure controlled facilities, employees are required to wear identification badges to distinguish themselves \nas authorized personnel. In remote environments, this control may not be applicable but should be supplemented by other identity \nverification methods where necessary.\nVisitor Management: Visitors and vendors must be escorted by an authorized employee at all times while on company premises. Visitor \naccess may not be applicable in remote locations, but employees are required to ensure the confidentiality and security of any sensitive \ninformation.\nIncident Reporting: All workforce members are responsible for reporting unauthorized visitors or access attempts to company facilities \nor systems. This includes both physical locations and remote work environments.

facilities, infrastructure, and sensitive data based on a risk-\nbased approach and implemented where feasible. \nAccess Restriction: Physical access to the company's secure facilities, such as server rooms and critical infrastructure, is restricted to \nauthorized personnel only. In remote locations, employees are responsible for securing access to company resources through digital \nmeans, such as VPNs and secure login systems.\nEmployee Identification: In secure controlled facilities, employees are required to wear identification badges to distinguish themselves \nas authorized personnel. In remote environments, this control may not be applicable but should be supplemented by other identity \nverification methods where necessary.\nVisitor Management: Visitors and vendors must be escorted by an authorized employee at all times while on company premises. Visitor \naccess may not be applicable in remote locations, but employees are required to ensure the confidentiality and security of any sensitive \ninformation.\nIncident Reporting: All workforce members are responsible for reporting unauthorized visitors or access attempts to company facilities \nor systems. This includes both physical locations and remote work environments. Reporting should be immediate to the Security Officer \nor Facility Manager.\nRecord-Keeping: It is recommended to retain a detailed record of each physical access, including visits, maintenance, and repairs \nwhere feasible.\nGiven the remote nature of many locations, physical controls will be implemented flexibly based on an assessment of the risks involved in \neach environment.\n3.2 Access Requirements\nPhysical access to secure facilities is managed through badge readers, smart locks, and physical keys. In environments where these \ncontrols are not applicable, such as coworking spaces, alternative security measures based on risk assessments will be applied.\nBadge and Key Management: Access to the company's badge and key systems is restricted to authorized personnel based on a need-\nto-know basis. Workforce members must report lost or stolen keys or badges immediately to their manager, and the Facility Manager \nmust re-provision access or change locks within 7 days.\nRestricted Areas: Secure areas, such as server rooms, must be locked when unattended, and access is granted only to authorized \nemployees. In remote or coworking environments, employees must ensure their devices and sensitive information are secured.\nVisitor Controls: Visitors must sign a log upon entering secure facilities, indicating the date, time, purpose, and point of contact. Visitor \nlogs must be kept for at least 3 months. In remote environments, visitor controls may not be applicable but should be replaced by strong \ndigital access controls.\nLoading and Delivery Areas: Access to loading and delivery areas is restricted to authorized personnel, and shipments should be \ninspected according to Asset Management procedures. In remote locations, this control may not be necessary but should be considered \nif the location handles sensitive assets.\n3.3 Maintenance and Monitoring\nContinuous monitoring and maintenance of physical security systems are crucial for protecting the company's assets. These requirements \napply primarily to formal company locations, while remote work environments may not require such stringent controls.\nMany of the company's operations take place either in its own offices or remotely, including at home, in cafes, or coworking spaces. \nThe company's own offices may also be considered as remote locations in certain contexts.\nAs a result, certain physical security controls, such as badge systems or visitor logs, may not be applicable to all environments. \nSecurity measures will be applied based on a risk-based approach and implemented where feasible.

All \naccess is regulated using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), adhering to the Principle of Least Privilege to ensure that each user has \nonly the necessary access required to perform their duties.\nMinimum Necessary Access: User access to systems is determined by job classification, ensuring that only the minimum necessary \nlevel of access is granted.\nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC): The assignment of user rights and access to systems is regulated by the RBAC method, \nensuring that access levels align with user roles and responsibilities.\nSegregation of Duties: The need for segregation of duties is considered when assigning user rights, preventing potential conflicts of \ninterest or undue concentration of authority.\nFormal Documentation and Authorization: All access requests, including the addition, deletion, and modification of user IDs, \nauthentication factors, and other identifying objects, must be documented and formally authorized.\nAccess Request Process: Workforce members initiate access requests by creating an issue in the company's ticketing system, \ndetailing the type of access needed.\nIdentity Verification: User identities must be verified in person whenever possible before granting access to new accounts. For remote \nemployees, verification may be conducted over the phone, with the method of verification recorded in the ticketing system.\nAuthorization by Security Officer: The Security Officer is responsible for granting or rejecting access based on the employee's role \nand job classification. If additional access is required, the requester must provide a valid reason as part of the request.\nReview and Documentation: If an access request is rejected, it must go through a further review process, with detailed documentation. \nApproved requests are marked as complete and include all pertinent notes.\nAccess to the company's systems is carefully regulated through RBAC, ensuring that users are granted only the minimum necessary access \nfor their roles. Formal documentation and identity verification are required, with reviews conducted for additional access requests to \nmaintain security and accountability.\n3.2 Access Reviews\nUser access to company systems and services will be subject to periodic reviews to ensure that accounts, including third-party or vendor \naccounts, are appropriately assigned based on job functions. These reviews help maintain compliance with the Principle of Least Privilege \nand ensure access rights are adjusted as needed.\nQuarterly Access Reviews: Management will conduct formal access reviews at least once every quarter to verify that the roles and \npermissions associated with all user accounts, including third-party or vendor accounts, are still appropriate.\nJob Function Alignment: Access reviews focus on ensuring that user roles and permissions are aligned with current job functions and \nthat no excess or unauthorized access exists.\nManagement Authorization: During the access review, management is responsible for confirming that user accounts are in compliance \nwith established authorization requirements.\nQuarterly access reviews ensure that user accounts, including third-party and vendor accounts, remain aligned with job responsibilities, \npreventing unnecessary or unauthorized access to sensitive systems. These reviews are a key part of the company's efforts to maintain \nappropriate security controls.\n3.3 User Identification and Authentication\nTo ensure the security of system components, users and administrators must be authenticated using at least one authentication factor. This \nprocess is critical to safeguarding the company's systems and sensitive information.\nAuthentication Factors: Access will require at least one of the following:\nSomething you know, such as a password or passphrase.\n\nSomething you have, such as a token device or smart card.\nSomething you are, such as a biometric element.\nUnique Login Credentials: Each user will have a unique login ID and password, ensuring individual accountability.\nAuthentication Requirements: Single sign-on (SSO) and minimum password requirements will be enforced based on the company's \nPassword Policy. Passwords will never be displayed, transmitted, or stored in plain text.\nDefault Accounts: Default accounts on all production systems, including root, will be deleted, disabled, or restricted to a limited number \nof authorized administrators. These accounts will only be used under exceptional circumstances with documented business justification \nand management approval.\nShared Accounts: The use of group, shared, or generic accounts is prohibited unless absolutely necessary and approved by \nmanagement. Individual user identity must be confirmed before access is granted, and all actions must be traceable to a specific user.\nAuthentication Tokens: Physical or logical tokens, smart cards, or certificates will be assigned to individual users and cannot be \nshared. Additional controls, such as PINs or biometric data, will ensure only authorized users can access accounts.\nAutomated Log-on: Automated log-on configurations, other than the company's approved password management tools, are prohibited \nfrom storing user passwords or bypassing password entry on workstations or production systems.\nThe company enforces strict identification and authentication policies, requiring the use of unique credentials, secure authentication factors, \nand limiting access to default and shared accounts. These measures ensure accountability and safeguard access to critical systems.\n3.4 Multi-factor Authentication\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all system access where technically feasible, providing an additional layer of security for \nusers, administrators, and third parties.\nUse of MFA: MFA will be enforced to enhance security by requiring multiple types of authentication for access to systems.\nSystem Configuration: Systems using MFA must:\nPrevent replay attacks through secure token generation and validation processes.\nRequire at least two distinct types of authentication factors (e.g., something you know, something you have, or something you are).\nRestrict any bypassing of MFA by users, including administrative users, unless specifically documented and approved by \nmanagement on an exception basis, for a limited time period.\nRemote Access: MFA is mandatory for all remote access to the company's network, including access by users, administrators, and \nthird-party vendors. This ensures that remote connections are secure and access is only granted to authenticated users.\nMulti-factor authentication is essential to securing system access, particularly for remote access scenarios. By requiring multiple \nauthentication factors and preventing unauthorized bypassing, the company maintains a high level of security for all users and systems.\n3.5 Automated Logoffs\nAutomated logoffs are implemented to secure devices and systems by minimizing unauthorized access due to inactivity.\nScreen Lock Timeout: Company-issued devices and any bring-your-own or third-party devices connected to company systems will \nenforce a screensaver lock with a timeout of 15 minutes or less of inactivity. This ensures that devices are locked when not actively in \nuse, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\nSystem Logoff: Where technically feasible, the company's applications and systems will automatically log users out after 15 minutes of \ninactivity or upon closure of the system or internet browser. This configuration secures the system by terminating sessions that may \notherwise remain vulnerable to unauthorized access.\nAutomated logoffs are an important control for ensuring security, by locking or logging out inactive sessions on both devices and systems. \nThese measures protect sensitive data by ensuring that unattended devices and open sessions are quickly secured.\n\n3.6 Third-Party Access\nThird-party access to the company's systems is strictly controlled to ensure security and accountability when external entities access critical \nsystem components.\nTime-Limited Access: Accounts provided to third parties for system access, support, or maintenance will be enabled only for the \nrequired time period. Access will be granted based on documented approval from management and will be promptly disabled once the \nspecific task is completed.\nMonitoring of Remote Access: All third-party remote access will be continuously monitored by company personnel for any signs of \nunauthorized or unexpected activity. Monitoring will include real-time oversight and logging of access events to ensure accountability and \ndetect potential security risks.\nAuthorization and Documentation: All third-party access must be authorized by management, with clear documentation outlining the \npurpose, duration, and scope of access. No third-party access will be granted without proper authorization.\nThird-party access is restricted and closely monitored to ensure that external entities are granted system access only when necessary, with \nappropriate safeguards in place to detect and address any unauthorized activity.\n3.7 Application and System Accounts\nApplication and system accounts will be managed to ensure access is limited to only what is necessary for system operability and will follow \nstrict guidelines for security.\nProvisioning of Accounts: All application and system accounts will be provisioned based on documented authorization from \nmanagement. Access privileges will be limited to only what is necessary for the application or system to function effectively, \nminimizing unnecessary access.\nInteractive Login Management: \nPrevention of Interactive Use: Interactive login through system or application accounts will be prevented unless specifically \nrequired for an exceptional circumstance. \nTime-Limited Access: If interactive access is required, it will be restricted to the necessary timeframe to complete the required \ntask. \nBusiness Justification: A documented business justification must accompany any request for interactive login, explaining why \nsuch access is necessary.\nManagement Approval: Interactive use must be explicitly approved by management, ensuring that only authorized personnel can \nuse the account.\nAccountability: Every action taken using an interactive account must be attributable to an individual user. Individual user identity \nwill be confirmed before access is granted.\nApplication and system accounts will be tightly controlled to ensure that they are only used for necessary system operations, with interactive \naccess limited to exceptional circumstances and approved by management. Every action must be linked to an identifiable user to maintain \naccountability.\n3.8 Use of Utility Programs\nAccess to utility programs that have the potential to bypass normal operating system or application controls will be restricted to authorized \npersonnel to maintain the security and integrity of the company's systems.\nRestricted Access to Utility Programs: Only authorized system administrators will have access to manage utility programs such as \nanti-virus consoles, diagnostic tools, patching software, backup utilities, and network tools. These programs will be restricted from \ngeneral user access due to their ability to bypass normal security controls.\nPrivileged Utility Access Control: \nStandard User Restrictions: Standard users will be restricted from accessing privileged utilities or making modifications to their \nconfigurations.\n\nAuthentication and Access Controls: Strict authentication mechanisms and access controls will be implemented to ensure only \nauthorized administrators can access or modify utility programs, preventing unauthorized changes to the system.\nUtility programs with the ability to bypass security controls will be strictly restricted to authorized system administrators, with standard users \ndenied access. This ensures the integrity of system configurations and limits unauthorized access to privileged tools.\n3.9 Employee Termination/Offboarding Procedures\nThe company will revoke system and physical access for terminated users (employees, third parties, vendors, and other personnel) \npromptly to safeguard its systems and data.\nAccess Revocation: System and physical access will be revoked within one business day of the termination date. This applies to all \nterminated users including employees, vendors, and third parties.\nTermination Checklist and Notification:\nThe HR/People department, along with the users and their supervisors, are responsible for notifying system administrators of \nupcoming separations and ensuring the completion of a \"Termination Checklist.\"\nSystem administrators will terminate access rights within the established service level agreements (SLAs) upon notification of \ntermination or separation.\nAsset Return Tracking: \nThe HR/People department (or designated department) will track the return of all electronic and physical assets, including \nlaptops, files, access mechanisms (such as keys, access cards, badges, and multi-factor authentication tokens) as part of the \noffboarding process.\nIncident-Based Access Termination:\nSystem administrators will terminate a user's access if there is evidence or suspicion that:\nThe user has been misusing their access rights.\nA user's password has been compromised. If the user is not responsible for the password compromise, a new password may \nbe provided.\nUpon termination, the company ensures that access to systems and physical locations is revoked within one business day, while the \nHR/People department oversees asset returns and the completion of termination procedures. Access is also terminated if there is misuse or \nevidence of a password compromise.\n3.10 Disabling Accounts: High-Risk Users\nThe company will disable accounts of users deemed to pose a high risk to its systems and data. Accounts will be disabled for a specified \nperiod depending on the risk severity.\nUser intends to sell company information to a competitor Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser accesses unauthorized sensitive data without a business \nneed \nImmediately                 3 weeks                     \nUser deliberately attempts to bypass security controls Immediately                 6 weeks                     \nUser leaks confidential information to external parties Immediately                 2 months                    \nUser violates policy by sharing credentials Immediately                 2 weeks                     \nUser installs unauthorized software or malware Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser repeatedly fails to comply with security procedures Immediately                 4 weeks                     \nUser uses company resources for illegal activities Immediately                 Permanent Disablement       \nRiskTime Period to DisableDuration of Disablement\n\nHigh-risk accounts will be disabled promptly based on the nature of the risk and the severity of the violation.

These accounts will only be used under exceptional circumstances with documented business justification \nand management approval.\nShared Accounts: The use of group, shared, or generic accounts is prohibited unless absolutely necessary and approved by \nmanagement. Individual user identity must be confirmed before access is granted, and all actions must be traceable to a specific user.\nAuthentication Tokens: Physical or logical tokens, smart cards, or certificates will be assigned to individual users and cannot be \nshared. Additional controls, such as PINs or biometric data, will ensure only authorized users can access accounts.\nAutomated Log-on: Automated log-on configurations, other than the company's approved password management tools, are prohibited \nfrom storing user passwords or bypassing password entry on workstations or production systems.\nThe company enforces strict identification and authentication policies, requiring the use of unique credentials, secure authentication factors, \nand limiting access to default and shared accounts. These measures ensure accountability and safeguard access to critical systems.\n3.4 Multi-factor Authentication\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all system access where technically feasible, providing an additional layer of security for \nusers, administrators, and third parties.\nUse of MFA: MFA will be enforced to enhance security by requiring multiple types of authentication for access to systems.\nSystem Configuration: Systems using MFA must:\nPrevent replay attacks through secure token generation and validation processes.\nRequire at least two distinct types of authentication factors (e.g., something you know, something you have, or something you are).\nRestrict any bypassing of MFA by users, including administrative users, unless specifically documented and approved by \nmanagement on an exception basis, for a limited time period.\nRemote Access: MFA is mandatory for all remote access to the company's network, including access by users, administrators, and \nthird-party vendors. This ensures that remote connections are secure and access is only granted to authenticated users.\nMulti-factor authentication is essential to securing system access, particularly for remote access scenarios. By requiring multiple \nauthentication factors and preventing unauthorized bypassing, the company maintains a high level of security for all users and systems.\n3.5 Automated Logoffs\nAutomated logoffs are implemented to secure devices and systems by minimizing unauthorized access due to inactivity.\nScreen Lock Timeout: Company-issued devices and any bring-your-own or third-party devices connected to company systems will \nenforce a screensaver lock with a timeout of 15 minutes or less of inactivity. This ensures that devices are locked when not actively in \nuse, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\nSystem Logoff: Where technically feasible, the company's applications and systems will automatically log users out after 15 minutes of \ninactivity or upon closure of the system or internet browser. This configuration secures the system by terminating sessions that may \notherwise remain vulnerable to unauthorized access.\nAutomated logoffs are an important control for ensuring security, by locking or logging out inactive sessions on both devices and systems. \nThese measures protect sensitive data by ensuring that unattended devices and open sessions are quickly secured.\n\n3.6 Third-Party Access\nThird-party access to the company's systems is strictly controlled to ensure security and accountability when external entities access critical \nsystem components.\nTime-Limited Access: Accounts provided to third parties for system access, support, or maintenance will be enabled only for the \nrequired time period. Access will be granted based on documented approval from management and will be promptly disabled once the \nspecific task is completed.\nMonitoring of Remote Access: All third-party remote access will be continuously monitored by company personnel for any signs of \nunauthorized or unexpected activity. Monitoring will include real-time oversight and logging of access events to ensure accountability and \ndetect potential security risks.\nAuthorization and Documentation: All third-party access must be authorized by management, with clear documentation outlining the \npurpose, duration, and scope of access. No third-party access will be granted without proper authorization.\nThird-party access is restricted and closely monitored to ensure that external entities are granted system access only when necessary, with \nappropriate safeguards in place to detect and address any unauthorized activity.\n3.7 Application and System Accounts\nApplication and system accounts will be managed to ensure access is limited to only what is necessary for system operability and will follow \nstrict guidelines for security.\nProvisioning of Accounts: All application and system accounts will be provisioned based on documented authorization from \nmanagement. Access privileges will be limited to only what is necessary for the application or system to function effectively, \nminimizing unnecessary access.\nInteractive Login Management: \nPrevention of Interactive Use: Interactive login through system or application accounts will be prevented unless specifically \nrequired for an exceptional circumstance. \nTime-Limited Access: If interactive access is required, it will be restricted to the necessary timeframe to complete the required \ntask. \nBusiness Justification: A documented business justification must accompany any request for interactive login, explaining why \nsuch access is necessary.\nManagement Approval: Interactive use must be explicitly approved by management, ensuring that only authorized personnel can \nuse the account.\nAccountability: Every action taken using an interactive account must be attributable to an individual user. Individual user identity \nwill be confirmed before access is granted.\nApplication and system accounts will be tightly controlled to ensure that they are only used for necessary system operations, with interactive \naccess limited to exceptional circumstances and approved by management. Every action must be linked to an identifiable user to maintain \naccountability.\n3.8 Use of Utility Programs\nAccess to utility programs that have the potential to bypass normal operating system or application controls will be restricted to authorized \npersonnel to maintain the security and integrity of the company's systems.\nRestricted Access to Utility Programs: Only authorized system administrators will have access to manage utility programs such as \nanti-virus consoles, diagnostic tools, patching software, backup utilities, and network tools. These programs will be restricted from \ngeneral user access due to their ability to bypass normal security controls.\nPrivileged Utility Access Control: \nStandard User Restrictions: Standard users will be restricted from accessing privileged utilities or making modifications to their \nconfigurations.\n\nAuthentication and Access Controls: Strict authentication mechanisms and access controls will be implemented to ensure only \nauthorized administrators can access or modify utility programs, preventing unauthorized changes to the system.\nUtility programs with the ability to bypass security controls will be strictly restricted to authorized system administrators, with standard users \ndenied access. This ensures the integrity of system configurations and limits unauthorized access to privileged tools.\n3.9 Employee Termination/Offboarding Procedures\nThe company will revoke system and physical access for terminated users (employees, third parties, vendors, and other personnel) \npromptly to safeguard its systems and data.\nAccess Revocation: System and physical access will be revoked within one business day of the termination date. This applies to all \nterminated users including employees, vendors, and third parties.\nTermination Checklist and Notification:\nThe HR/People department, along with the users and their supervisors, are responsible for notifying system administrators of \nupcoming separations and ensuring the completion of a \"Termination Checklist.\"\nSystem administrators will terminate access rights within the established service level agreements (SLAs) upon notification of \ntermination or separation.\nAsset Return Tracking: \nThe HR/People department (or designated department) will track the return of all electronic and physical assets, including \nlaptops, files, access mechanisms (such as keys, access cards, badges, and multi-factor authentication tokens) as part of the \noffboarding process.\nIncident-Based Access Termination:\nSystem administrators will terminate a user's access if there is evidence or suspicion that:\nThe user has been misusing their access rights.\nA user's password has been compromised. If the user is not responsible for the password compromise, a new password may \nbe provided.\nUpon termination, the company ensures that access to systems and physical locations is revoked within one business day, while the \nHR/People department oversees asset returns and the completion of termination procedures. Access is also terminated if there is misuse or \nevidence of a password compromise.\n3.10 Disabling Accounts: High-Risk Users\nThe company will disable accounts of users deemed to pose a high risk to its systems and data. Accounts will be disabled for a specified \nperiod depending on the risk severity.\nUser intends to sell company information to a competitor Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser accesses unauthorized sensitive data without a business \nneed \nImmediately                 3 weeks                     \nUser deliberately attempts to bypass security controls Immediately                 6 weeks                     \nUser leaks confidential information to external parties Immediately                 2 months                    \nUser violates policy by sharing credentials Immediately                 2 weeks                     \nUser installs unauthorized software or malware Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser repeatedly fails to comply with security procedures Immediately                 4 weeks                     \nUser uses company resources for illegal activities Immediately                 Permanent Disablement       \nRiskTime Period to DisableDuration of Disablement\n\nHigh-risk accounts will be disabled promptly based on the nature of the risk and the severity of the violation.

All \naccess is regulated using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), adhering to the Principle of Least Privilege to ensure that each user has \nonly the necessary access required to perform their duties.\nMinimum Necessary Access: User access to systems is determined by job classification, ensuring that only the minimum necessary \nlevel of access is granted.\nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC): The assignment of user rights and access to systems is regulated by the RBAC method, \nensuring that access levels align with user roles and responsibilities.\nSegregation of Duties: The need for segregation of duties is considered when assigning user rights, preventing potential conflicts of \ninterest or undue concentration of authority.\nFormal Documentation and Authorization: All access requests, including the addition, deletion, and modification of user IDs, \nauthentication factors, and other identifying objects, must be documented and formally authorized.\nAccess Request Process: Workforce members initiate access requests by creating an issue in the company's ticketing system, \ndetailing the type of access needed.\nIdentity Verification: User identities must be verified in person whenever possible before granting access to new accounts. For remote \nemployees, verification may be conducted over the phone, with the method of verification recorded in the ticketing system.\nAuthorization by Security Officer: The Security Officer is responsible for granting or rejecting access based on the employee's role \nand job classification. If additional access is required, the requester must provide a valid reason as part of the request.\nReview and Documentation: If an access request is rejected, it must go through a further review process, with detailed documentation. \nApproved requests are marked as complete and include all pertinent notes.\nAccess to the company's systems is carefully regulated through RBAC, ensuring that users are granted only the minimum necessary access \nfor their roles. Formal documentation and identity verification are required, with reviews conducted for additional access requests to \nmaintain security and accountability.\n3.2 Access Reviews\nUser access to company systems and services will be subject to periodic reviews to ensure that accounts, including third-party or vendor \naccounts, are appropriately assigned based on job functions. These reviews help maintain compliance with the Principle of Least Privilege \nand ensure access rights are adjusted as needed.\nQuarterly Access Reviews: Management will conduct formal access reviews at least once every quarter to verify that the roles and \npermissions associated with all user accounts, including third-party or vendor accounts, are still appropriate.\nJob Function Alignment: Access reviews focus on ensuring that user roles and permissions are aligned with current job functions and \nthat no excess or unauthorized access exists.\nManagement Authorization: During the access review, management is responsible for confirming that user accounts are in compliance \nwith established authorization requirements.\nQuarterly access reviews ensure that user accounts, including third-party and vendor accounts, remain aligned with job responsibilities, \npreventing unnecessary or unauthorized access to sensitive systems. These reviews are a key part of the company's efforts to maintain \nappropriate security controls.\n3.3 User Identification and Authentication\nTo ensure the security of system components, users and administrators must be authenticated using at least one authentication factor. This \nprocess is critical to safeguarding the company's systems and sensitive information.\nAuthentication Factors: Access will require at least one of the following:\nSomething you know, such as a password or passphrase.\n\nSomething you have, such as a token device or smart card.\nSomething you are, such as a biometric element.\nUnique Login Credentials: Each user will have a unique login ID and password, ensuring individual accountability.\nAuthentication Requirements: Single sign-on (SSO) and minimum password requirements will be enforced based on the company's \nPassword Policy. Passwords will never be displayed, transmitted, or stored in plain text.\nDefault Accounts: Default accounts on all production systems, including root, will be deleted, disabled, or restricted to a limited number \nof authorized administrators. These accounts will only be used under exceptional circumstances with documented business justification \nand management approval.\nShared Accounts: The use of group, shared, or generic accounts is prohibited unless absolutely necessary and approved by \nmanagement. Individual user identity must be confirmed before access is granted, and all actions must be traceable to a specific user.\nAuthentication Tokens: Physical or logical tokens, smart cards, or certificates will be assigned to individual users and cannot be \nshared. Additional controls, such as PINs or biometric data, will ensure only authorized users can access accounts.\nAutomated Log-on: Automated log-on configurations, other than the company's approved password management tools, are prohibited \nfrom storing user passwords or bypassing password entry on workstations or production systems.\nThe company enforces strict identification and authentication policies, requiring the use of unique credentials, secure authentication factors, \nand limiting access to default and shared accounts. These measures ensure accountability and safeguard access to critical systems.\n3.4 Multi-factor Authentication\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all system access where technically feasible, providing an additional layer of security for \nusers, administrators, and third parties.\nUse of MFA: MFA will be enforced to enhance security by requiring multiple types of authentication for access to systems.\nSystem Configuration: Systems using MFA must:\nPrevent replay attacks through secure token generation and validation processes.\nRequire at least two distinct types of authentication factors (e.g., something you know, something you have, or something you are).\nRestrict any bypassing of MFA by users, including administrative users, unless specifically documented and approved by \nmanagement on an exception basis, for a limited time period.\nRemote Access: MFA is mandatory for all remote access to the company's network, including access by users, administrators, and \nthird-party vendors. This ensures that remote connections are secure and access is only granted to authenticated users.\nMulti-factor authentication is essential to securing system access, particularly for remote access scenarios. By requiring multiple \nauthentication factors and preventing unauthorized bypassing, the company maintains a high level of security for all users and systems.\n3.5 Automated Logoffs\nAutomated logoffs are implemented to secure devices and systems by minimizing unauthorized access due to inactivity.\nScreen Lock Timeout: Company-issued devices and any bring-your-own or third-party devices connected to company systems will \nenforce a screensaver lock with a timeout of 15 minutes or less of inactivity. This ensures that devices are locked when not actively in \nuse, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\nSystem Logoff: Where technically feasible, the company's applications and systems will automatically log users out after 15 minutes of \ninactivity or upon closure of the system or internet browser. This configuration secures the system by terminating sessions that may \notherwise remain vulnerable to unauthorized access.\nAutomated logoffs are an important control for ensuring security, by locking or logging out inactive sessions on both devices and systems. \nThese measures protect sensitive data by ensuring that unattended devices and open sessions are quickly secured.\n\n3.6 Third-Party Access\nThird-party access to the company's systems is strictly controlled to ensure security and accountability when external entities access critical \nsystem components.\nTime-Limited Access: Accounts provided to third parties for system access, support, or maintenance will be enabled only for the \nrequired time period. Access will be granted based on documented approval from management and will be promptly disabled once the \nspecific task is completed.\nMonitoring of Remote Access: All third-party remote access will be continuously monitored by company personnel for any signs of \nunauthorized or unexpected activity. Monitoring will include real-time oversight and logging of access events to ensure accountability and \ndetect potential security risks.\nAuthorization and Documentation: All third-party access must be authorized by management, with clear documentation outlining the \npurpose, duration, and scope of access. No third-party access will be granted without proper authorization.\nThird-party access is restricted and closely monitored to ensure that external entities are granted system access only when necessary, with \nappropriate safeguards in place to detect and address any unauthorized activity.\n3.7 Application and System Accounts\nApplication and system accounts will be managed to ensure access is limited to only what is necessary for system operability and will follow \nstrict guidelines for security.\nProvisioning of Accounts: All application and system accounts will be provisioned based on documented authorization from \nmanagement. Access privileges will be limited to only what is necessary for the application or system to function effectively, \nminimizing unnecessary access.\nInteractive Login Management: \nPrevention of Interactive Use: Interactive login through system or application accounts will be prevented unless specifically \nrequired for an exceptional circumstance. \nTime-Limited Access: If interactive access is required, it will be restricted to the necessary timeframe to complete the required \ntask. \nBusiness Justification: A documented business justification must accompany any request for interactive login, explaining why \nsuch access is necessary.\nManagement Approval: Interactive use must be explicitly approved by management, ensuring that only authorized personnel can \nuse the account.\nAccountability: Every action taken using an interactive account must be attributable to an individual user. Individual user identity \nwill be confirmed before access is granted.\nApplication and system accounts will be tightly controlled to ensure that they are only used for necessary system operations, with interactive \naccess limited to exceptional circumstances and approved by management. Every action must be linked to an identifiable user to maintain \naccountability.\n3.8 Use of Utility Programs\nAccess to utility programs that have the potential to bypass normal operating system or application controls will be restricted to authorized \npersonnel to maintain the security and integrity of the company's systems.\nRestricted Access to Utility Programs: Only authorized system administrators will have access to manage utility programs such as \nanti-virus consoles, diagnostic tools, patching software, backup utilities, and network tools. These programs will be restricted from \ngeneral user access due to their ability to bypass normal security controls.\nPrivileged Utility Access Control: \nStandard User Restrictions: Standard users will be restricted from accessing privileged utilities or making modifications to their \nconfigurations.\n\nAuthentication and Access Controls: Strict authentication mechanisms and access controls will be implemented to ensure only \nauthorized administrators can access or modify utility programs, preventing unauthorized changes to the system.\nUtility programs with the ability to bypass security controls will be strictly restricted to authorized system administrators, with standard users \ndenied access. This ensures the integrity of system configurations and limits unauthorized access to privileged tools.\n3.9 Employee Termination/Offboarding Procedures\nThe company will revoke system and physical access for terminated users (employees, third parties, vendors, and other personnel) \npromptly to safeguard its systems and data.\nAccess Revocation: System and physical access will be revoked within one business day of the termination date. This applies to all \nterminated users including employees, vendors, and third parties.\nTermination Checklist and Notification:\nThe HR/People department, along with the users and their supervisors, are responsible for notifying system administrators of \nupcoming separations and ensuring the completion of a \"Termination Checklist.\"\nSystem administrators will terminate access rights within the established service level agreements (SLAs) upon notification of \ntermination or separation.\nAsset Return Tracking: \nThe HR/People department (or designated department) will track the return of all electronic and physical assets, including \nlaptops, files, access mechanisms (such as keys, access cards, badges, and multi-factor authentication tokens) as part of the \noffboarding process.\nIncident-Based Access Termination:\nSystem administrators will terminate a user's access if there is evidence or suspicion that:\nThe user has been misusing their access rights.\nA user's password has been compromised. If the user is not responsible for the password compromise, a new password may \nbe provided.\nUpon termination, the company ensures that access to systems and physical locations is revoked within one business day, while the \nHR/People department oversees asset returns and the completion of termination procedures. Access is also terminated if there is misuse or \nevidence of a password compromise.\n3.10 Disabling Accounts: High-Risk Users\nThe company will disable accounts of users deemed to pose a high risk to its systems and data. Accounts will be disabled for a specified \nperiod depending on the risk severity.\nUser intends to sell company information to a competitor Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser accesses unauthorized sensitive data without a business \nneed \nImmediately                 3 weeks                     \nUser deliberately attempts to bypass security controls Immediately                 6 weeks                     \nUser leaks confidential information to external parties Immediately                 2 months                    \nUser violates policy by sharing credentials Immediately                 2 weeks                     \nUser installs unauthorized software or malware Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser repeatedly fails to comply with security procedures Immediately                 4 weeks                     \nUser uses company resources for illegal activities Immediately                 Permanent Disablement       \nRiskTime Period to DisableDuration of Disablement\n\nHigh-risk accounts will be disabled promptly based on the nature of the risk and the severity of the violation.

All \naccess is regulated using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), adhering to the Principle of Least Privilege to ensure that each user has \nonly the necessary access required to perform their duties.\nMinimum Necessary Access: User access to systems is determined by job classification, ensuring that only the minimum necessary \nlevel of access is granted.\nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC): The assignment of user rights and access to systems is regulated by the RBAC method, \nensuring that access levels align with user roles and responsibilities.\nSegregation of Duties: The need for segregation of duties is considered when assigning user rights, preventing potential conflicts of \ninterest or undue concentration of authority.\nFormal Documentation and Authorization: All access requests, including the addition, deletion, and modification of user IDs, \nauthentication factors, and other identifying objects, must be documented and formally authorized.\nAccess Request Process: Workforce members initiate access requests by creating an issue in the company's ticketing system, \ndetailing the type of access needed.\nIdentity Verification: User identities must be verified in person whenever possible before granting access to new accounts. For remote \nemployees, verification may be conducted over the phone, with the method of verification recorded in the ticketing system.\nAuthorization by Security Officer: The Security Officer is responsible for granting or rejecting access based on the employee's role \nand job classification. If additional access is required, the requester must provide a valid reason as part of the request.\nReview and Documentation: If an access request is rejected, it must go through a further review process, with detailed documentation. \nApproved requests are marked as complete and include all pertinent notes.\nAccess to the company's systems is carefully regulated through RBAC, ensuring that users are granted only the minimum necessary access \nfor their roles. Formal documentation and identity verification are required, with reviews conducted for additional access requests to \nmaintain security and accountability.\n3.2 Access Reviews\nUser access to company systems and services will be subject to periodic reviews to ensure that accounts, including third-party or vendor \naccounts, are appropriately assigned based on job functions. These reviews help maintain compliance with the Principle of Least Privilege \nand ensure access rights are adjusted as needed.\nQuarterly Access Reviews: Management will conduct formal access reviews at least once every quarter to verify that the roles and \npermissions associated with all user accounts, including third-party or vendor accounts, are still appropriate.\nJob Function Alignment: Access reviews focus on ensuring that user roles and permissions are aligned with current job functions and \nthat no excess or unauthorized access exists.\nManagement Authorization: During the access review, management is responsible for confirming that user accounts are in compliance \nwith established authorization requirements.\nQuarterly access reviews ensure that user accounts, including third-party and vendor accounts, remain aligned with job responsibilities, \npreventing unnecessary or unauthorized access to sensitive systems. These reviews are a key part of the company's efforts to maintain \nappropriate security controls.\n3.3 User Identification and Authentication\nTo ensure the security of system components, users and administrators must be authenticated using at least one authentication factor. This \nprocess is critical to safeguarding the company's systems and sensitive information.\nAuthentication Factors: Access will require at least one of the following:\nSomething you know, such as a password or passphrase.\n\nSomething you have, such as a token device or smart card.\nSomething you are, such as a biometric element.\nUnique Login Credentials: Each user will have a unique login ID and password, ensuring individual accountability.\nAuthentication Requirements: Single sign-on (SSO) and minimum password requirements will be enforced based on the company's \nPassword Policy. Passwords will never be displayed, transmitted, or stored in plain text.\nDefault Accounts: Default accounts on all production systems, including root, will be deleted, disabled, or restricted to a limited number \nof authorized administrators. These accounts will only be used under exceptional circumstances with documented business justification \nand management approval.\nShared Accounts: The use of group, shared, or generic accounts is prohibited unless absolutely necessary and approved by \nmanagement. Individual user identity must be confirmed before access is granted, and all actions must be traceable to a specific user.\nAuthentication Tokens: Physical or logical tokens, smart cards, or certificates will be assigned to individual users and cannot be \nshared. Additional controls, such as PINs or biometric data, will ensure only authorized users can access accounts.\nAutomated Log-on: Automated log-on configurations, other than the company's approved password management tools, are prohibited \nfrom storing user passwords or bypassing password entry on workstations or production systems.\nThe company enforces strict identification and authentication policies, requiring the use of unique credentials, secure authentication factors, \nand limiting access to default and shared accounts. These measures ensure accountability and safeguard access to critical systems.\n3.4 Multi-factor Authentication\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all system access where technically feasible, providing an additional layer of security for \nusers, administrators, and third parties.\nUse of MFA: MFA will be enforced to enhance security by requiring multiple types of authentication for access to systems.\nSystem Configuration: Systems using MFA must:\nPrevent replay attacks through secure token generation and validation processes.\nRequire at least two distinct types of authentication factors (e.g., something you know, something you have, or something you are).\nRestrict any bypassing of MFA by users, including administrative users, unless specifically documented and approved by \nmanagement on an exception basis, for a limited time period.\nRemote Access: MFA is mandatory for all remote access to the company's network, including access by users, administrators, and \nthird-party vendors. This ensures that remote connections are secure and access is only granted to authenticated users.\nMulti-factor authentication is essential to securing system access, particularly for remote access scenarios. By requiring multiple \nauthentication factors and preventing unauthorized bypassing, the company maintains a high level of security for all users and systems.\n3.5 Automated Logoffs\nAutomated logoffs are implemented to secure devices and systems by minimizing unauthorized access due to inactivity.\nScreen Lock Timeout: Company-issued devices and any bring-your-own or third-party devices connected to company systems will \nenforce a screensaver lock with a timeout of 15 minutes or less of inactivity. This ensures that devices are locked when not actively in \nuse, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\nSystem Logoff: Where technically feasible, the company's applications and systems will automatically log users out after 15 minutes of \ninactivity or upon closure of the system or internet browser. This configuration secures the system by terminating sessions that may \notherwise remain vulnerable to unauthorized access.\nAutomated logoffs are an important control for ensuring security, by locking or logging out inactive sessions on both devices and systems. \nThese measures protect sensitive data by ensuring that unattended devices and open sessions are quickly secured.\n\n3.6 Third-Party Access\nThird-party access to the company's systems is strictly controlled to ensure security and accountability when external entities access critical \nsystem components.\nTime-Limited Access: Accounts provided to third parties for system access, support, or maintenance will be enabled only for the \nrequired time period. Access will be granted based on documented approval from management and will be promptly disabled once the \nspecific task is completed.\nMonitoring of Remote Access: All third-party remote access will be continuously monitored by company personnel for any signs of \nunauthorized or unexpected activity. Monitoring will include real-time oversight and logging of access events to ensure accountability and \ndetect potential security risks.\nAuthorization and Documentation: All third-party access must be authorized by management, with clear documentation outlining the \npurpose, duration, and scope of access. No third-party access will be granted without proper authorization.\nThird-party access is restricted and closely monitored to ensure that external entities are granted system access only when necessary, with \nappropriate safeguards in place to detect and address any unauthorized activity.\n3.7 Application and System Accounts\nApplication and system accounts will be managed to ensure access is limited to only what is necessary for system operability and will follow \nstrict guidelines for security.\nProvisioning of Accounts: All application and system accounts will be provisioned based on documented authorization from \nmanagement. Access privileges will be limited to only what is necessary for the application or system to function effectively, \nminimizing unnecessary access.\nInteractive Login Management: \nPrevention of Interactive Use: Interactive login through system or application accounts will be prevented unless specifically \nrequired for an exceptional circumstance. \nTime-Limited Access: If interactive access is required, it will be restricted to the necessary timeframe to complete the required \ntask. \nBusiness Justification: A documented business justification must accompany any request for interactive login, explaining why \nsuch access is necessary.\nManagement Approval: Interactive use must be explicitly approved by management, ensuring that only authorized personnel can \nuse the account.\nAccountability: Every action taken using an interactive account must be attributable to an individual user. Individual user identity \nwill be confirmed before access is granted.\nApplication and system accounts will be tightly controlled to ensure that they are only used for necessary system operations, with interactive \naccess limited to exceptional circumstances and approved by management. Every action must be linked to an identifiable user to maintain \naccountability.\n3.8 Use of Utility Programs\nAccess to utility programs that have the potential to bypass normal operating system or application controls will be restricted to authorized \npersonnel to maintain the security and integrity of the company's systems.\nRestricted Access to Utility Programs: Only authorized system administrators will have access to manage utility programs such as \nanti-virus consoles, diagnostic tools, patching software, backup utilities, and network tools. These programs will be restricted from \ngeneral user access due to their ability to bypass normal security controls.\nPrivileged Utility Access Control: \nStandard User Restrictions: Standard users will be restricted from accessing privileged utilities or making modifications to their \nconfigurations.\n\nAuthentication and Access Controls: Strict authentication mechanisms and access controls will be implemented to ensure only \nauthorized administrators can access or modify utility programs, preventing unauthorized changes to the system.\nUtility programs with the ability to bypass security controls will be strictly restricted to authorized system administrators, with standard users \ndenied access. This ensures the integrity of system configurations and limits unauthorized access to privileged tools.\n3.9 Employee Termination/Offboarding Procedures\nThe company will revoke system and physical access for terminated users (employees, third parties, vendors, and other personnel) \npromptly to safeguard its systems and data.\nAccess Revocation: System and physical access will be revoked within one business day of the termination date. This applies to all \nterminated users including employees, vendors, and third parties.\nTermination Checklist and Notification:\nThe HR/People department, along with the users and their supervisors, are responsible for notifying system administrators of \nupcoming separations and ensuring the completion of a \"Termination Checklist.\"\nSystem administrators will terminate access rights within the established service level agreements (SLAs) upon notification of \ntermination or separation.\nAsset Return Tracking: \nThe HR/People department (or designated department) will track the return of all electronic and physical assets, including \nlaptops, files, access mechanisms (such as keys, access cards, badges, and multi-factor authentication tokens) as part of the \noffboarding process.\nIncident-Based Access Termination:\nSystem administrators will terminate a user's access if there is evidence or suspicion that:\nThe user has been misusing their access rights.\nA user's password has been compromised. If the user is not responsible for the password compromise, a new password may \nbe provided.\nUpon termination, the company ensures that access to systems and physical locations is revoked within one business day, while the \nHR/People department oversees asset returns and the completion of termination procedures. Access is also terminated if there is misuse or \nevidence of a password compromise.\n3.10 Disabling Accounts: High-Risk Users\nThe company will disable accounts of users deemed to pose a high risk to its systems and data. Accounts will be disabled for a specified \nperiod depending on the risk severity.\nUser intends to sell company information to a competitor Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser accesses unauthorized sensitive data without a business \nneed \nImmediately                 3 weeks                     \nUser deliberately attempts to bypass security controls Immediately                 6 weeks                     \nUser leaks confidential information to external parties Immediately                 2 months                    \nUser violates policy by sharing credentials Immediately                 2 weeks                     \nUser installs unauthorized software or malware Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser repeatedly fails to comply with security procedures Immediately                 4 weeks                     \nUser uses company resources for illegal activities Immediately                 Permanent Disablement       \nRiskTime Period to DisableDuration of Disablement\n\nHigh-risk accounts will be disabled promptly based on the nature of the risk and the severity of the violation.

By requiring multiple \nauthentication factors and preventing unauthorized bypassing, the company maintains a high level of security for all users and systems.\n3.5 Automated Logoffs\nAutomated logoffs are implemented to secure devices and systems by minimizing unauthorized access due to inactivity.\nScreen Lock Timeout: Company-issued devices and any bring-your-own or third-party devices connected to company systems will \nenforce a screensaver lock with a timeout of 15 minutes or less of inactivity. This ensures that devices are locked when not actively in \nuse, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\nSystem Logoff: Where technically feasible, the company's applications and systems will automatically log users out after 15 minutes of \ninactivity or upon closure of the system or internet browser. This configuration secures the system by terminating sessions that may \notherwise remain vulnerable to unauthorized access.\nAutomated logoffs are an important control for ensuring security, by locking or logging out inactive sessions on both devices and systems. \nThese measures protect sensitive data by ensuring that unattended devices and open sessions are quickly secured.\n\n3.6 Third-Party Access\nThird-party access to the company's systems is strictly controlled to ensure security and accountability when external entities access critical \nsystem components.\nTime-Limited Access: Accounts provided to third parties for system access, support, or maintenance will be enabled only for the \nrequired time period. Access will be granted based on documented approval from management and will be promptly disabled once the \nspecific task is completed.\nMonitoring of Remote Access: All third-party remote access will be continuously monitored by company personnel for any signs of \nunauthorized or unexpected activity. Monitoring will include real-time oversight and logging of access events to ensure accountability and \ndetect potential security risks.\nAuthorization and Documentation: All third-party access must be authorized by management, with clear documentation outlining the \npurpose, duration, and scope of access. No third-party access will be granted without proper authorization.\nThird-party access is restricted and closely monitored to ensure that external entities are granted system access only when necessary, with \nappropriate safeguards in place to detect and address any unauthorized activity.\n3.7 Application and System Accounts\nApplication and system accounts will be managed to ensure access is limited to only what is necessary for system operability and will follow \nstrict guidelines for security.\nProvisioning of Accounts: All application and system accounts will be provisioned based on documented authorization from \nmanagement. Access privileges will be limited to only what is necessary for the application or system to function effectively, \nminimizing unnecessary access.\nInteractive Login Management: \nPrevention of Interactive Use: Interactive login through system or application accounts will be prevented unless specifically \nrequired for an exceptional circumstance. \nTime-Limited Access: If interactive access is required, it will be restricted to the necessary timeframe to complete the required \ntask. \nBusiness Justification: A documented business justification must accompany any request for interactive login, explaining why \nsuch access is necessary.\nManagement Approval: Interactive use must be explicitly approved by management, ensuring that only authorized personnel can \nuse the account.\nAccountability: Every action taken using an interactive account must be attributable to an individual user. Individual user identity \nwill be confirmed before access is granted.\nApplication and system accounts will be tightly controlled to ensure that they are only used for necessary system operations, with interactive \naccess limited to exceptional circumstances and approved by management. Every action must be linked to an identifiable user to maintain \naccountability.\n3.8 Use of Utility Programs\nAccess to utility programs that have the potential to bypass normal operating system or application controls will be restricted to authorized \npersonnel to maintain the security and integrity of the company's systems.\nRestricted Access to Utility Programs: Only authorized system administrators will have access to manage utility programs such as \nanti-virus consoles, diagnostic tools, patching software, backup utilities, and network tools. These programs will be restricted from \ngeneral user access due to their ability to bypass normal security controls.\nPrivileged Utility Access Control: \nStandard User Restrictions: Standard users will be restricted from accessing privileged utilities or making modifications to their \nconfigurations.\n\nAuthentication and Access Controls: Strict authentication mechanisms and access controls will be implemented to ensure only \nauthorized administrators can access or modify utility programs, preventing unauthorized changes to the system.\nUtility programs with the ability to bypass security controls will be strictly restricted to authorized system administrators, with standard users \ndenied access. This ensures the integrity of system configurations and limits unauthorized access to privileged tools.\n3.9 Employee Termination/Offboarding Procedures\nThe company will revoke system and physical access for terminated users (employees, third parties, vendors, and other personnel) \npromptly to safeguard its systems and data.\nAccess Revocation: System and physical access will be revoked within one business day of the termination date. This applies to all \nterminated users including employees, vendors, and third parties.\nTermination Checklist and Notification:\nThe HR/People department, along with the users and their supervisors, are responsible for notifying system administrators of \nupcoming separations and ensuring the completion of a \"Termination Checklist.\"\nSystem administrators will terminate access rights within the established service level agreements (SLAs) upon notification of \ntermination or separation.\nAsset Return Tracking: \nThe HR/People department (or designated department) will track the return of all electronic and physical assets, including \nlaptops, files, access mechanisms (such as keys, access cards, badges, and multi-factor authentication tokens) as part of the \noffboarding process.\nIncident-Based Access Termination:\nSystem administrators will terminate a user's access if there is evidence or suspicion that:\nThe user has been misusing their access rights.\nA user's password has been compromised. If the user is not responsible for the password compromise, a new password may \nbe provided.\nUpon termination, the company ensures that access to systems and physical locations is revoked within one business day, while the \nHR/People department oversees asset returns and the completion of termination procedures. Access is also terminated if there is misuse or \nevidence of a password compromise.\n3.10 Disabling Accounts: High-Risk Users\nThe company will disable accounts of users deemed to pose a high risk to its systems and data. Accounts will be disabled for a specified \nperiod depending on the risk severity.\nUser intends to sell company information to a competitor Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser accesses unauthorized sensitive data without a business \nneed \nImmediately                 3 weeks                     \nUser deliberately attempts to bypass security controls Immediately                 6 weeks                     \nUser leaks confidential information to external parties Immediately                 2 months                    \nUser violates policy by sharing credentials Immediately                 2 weeks                     \nUser installs unauthorized software or malware Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser repeatedly fails to comply with security procedures Immediately                 4 weeks                     \nUser uses company resources for illegal activities Immediately                 Permanent Disablement       \nRiskTime Period to DisableDuration of Disablement\n\nHigh-risk accounts will be disabled promptly based on the nature of the risk and the severity of the violation.

The analysis will focus on identifying actionable vulnerabilities, prioritizing them based on \nseverity, and determining appropriate remediation steps.\nReporting and Resolution: The findings will be reported through the established security reporting process. Each vulnerability identified \nwill be documented, prioritized, and tracked until its resolution, following the company's defined Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for \naddressing security issues.\nRegular penetration testing, combined with thorough analysis and prompt resolution of identified vulnerabilities, is essential to maintaining \nthe security and resilience of the company's systems and infrastructure.\n\n3.4 Security Findings Reporting, Tracking, and Remediation\nThe company follows a streamlined vulnerability tracking process using Jira. All identified security findings, such as vulnerabilities in \nsoftware, systems, or processes, are tracked to resolution to ensure comprehensive remediation.\nReporting a Finding: Upon the identification of a vulnerability, a Jira ticket is created. This ticket includes a description of the finding, \nfurther details without any confidential information, and a link to the source of the issue.\nPriority Assignment: Each finding will be assigned a priority level within Jira based on its severity and potential impact on the \ncompany's systems and operations. The following priority levels are used:\nCritical\nHigh\nMedium\nLow\nTracking and Retention: The records of all findings are retained in Jira for a minimum period of 3 years, ensuring that the findings are \ndocumented for future audits, reviews, or follow-ups.\nRemediation Process: Once a finding is identified and recorded, it will be assigned to the owner responsible for the affected system or \nsoftware package. The assignee is responsible for addressing the finding according to the established Service Level Agreements \n(SLAs). Remediation can be completed through:\nImplementing a valid fix or mitigation.\nDetermining the finding is a false positive.\nDocumenting an approved exception when a fix is not feasible.\nValidation and Closure: After remediation, the finding is reassigned to the reporter or a member of the security team for validation. If \nvalidated, the finding is marked as closed in Jira. Fixes must be deployed to a development environment and have a targeted release \ndate for production deployment.\nThe company uses Jira to track and manage security vulnerabilities. All findings are reported, prioritized, and tracked to ensure they are \nremediated promptly, ensuring the security of the company's systems and data.\n3.5 Reporting a Finding\nUpon the identification of a vulnerability (whether in software, systems, or processes), a Jira ticket will be created.\nTicket Creation: A Jira ticket must be opened to record the vulnerability. This ticket acts as the primary means of documenting and \ntracking the issue through its lifecycle.\nDescription: The description of the finding should include comprehensive details about the vulnerability, while ensuring no confidential \ninformation is included. The description should provide a clear understanding of the issue and, where applicable, a link to the source of \nthe finding.\nPriority Assignment: The finding will be assigned a priority level in Jira based on its severity and potential impact. These levels include:\nCritical\nHigh\nMedium\nLow\nAll identified vulnerabilities are documented in Jira, with appropriate details and a priority level assigned. This process ensures \nvulnerabilities are properly tracked from discovery to remediation.\n3.6 Priority/Severity Ratings and Service Level Agreements\nIn order to address security vulnerabilities efficiently, the company has established the following timelines (Service Level Agreements - \nSLAs) for different priority levels. Each level is defined by its impact and specific examples.\nPriority LevelSLADescriptionImpactExamples\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities are categorized by their priority, with defined SLAs to ensure prompt resolution. The priority may change based on \nnew findings, which will adjust the response timeline accordingly.\n3.7 Priority Updates\nThe management of security vulnerabilities includes the flexibility to adjust priorities based on new information or a better understanding of \nthe impact and likelihood of exploitation. As a result, the following processes are applied when a priority is either upgraded or downgraded:\nPriority Upgrade: When new information or an increased threat is identified, the priority of a vulnerability may be upgraded (e.g., from \nMedium to High or Critical). In such cases, the SLA is reset, starting from the moment the escalation was made. This ensures that \nmore immediate attention is given to the vulnerability, and remediation efforts are accelerated based on its new urgency. The goal is to \nreflect the increased risk posed by the vulnerability and address it as quickly as possible.\nPriority Downgrade: When further analysis reveals that a vulnerability poses less risk than initially assessed, the priority may be \ndowngraded (e.g., from Critical to Medium). In this situation, the SLA remains unchanged and continues to follow the original timeline \nestablished when the vulnerability was first identified. This ensures that there is no undue delay in remediation, while still allowing for \nlower-priority vulnerabilities to be resolved within a more appropriate timeframe.\nThese updates help ensure that vulnerabilities are treated with the appropriate level of urgency and that remediation timelines remain \naligned with the evolving threat landscape.\n3.8 Resolving a Finding\nThe process for resolving a vulnerability finding is structured to ensure proper accountability and timely remediation. The following steps \noutline how findings should be handled:\nAssignment of Ownership: Each finding must be assigned to the owner responsible for the system, software package, or component \nwhere the vulnerability exists. The owner is accountable for ensuring that the finding is addressed appropriately.\nAddressing Findings Within SLAs: All findings must be resolved according to the established Service Level Agreements (SLAs) based \non the severity and priority level of the vulnerability. It is crucial that these timelines are adhered to, ensuring vulnerabilities are \nCritical 24-48 hoursImmediate action required; vulnerabilities \nthat pose an imminent threat, such as \nremote code execution, data theft, or \nadmin privilege escalation. These must be \naddressed as a top priority to prevent \nsevere impact.\nVulnerabilities causing \nprivilege escalation to \nadmin, remote code \nexecution, financial theft, \nunauthorized access, or \ndata extraction. \nRCE, Vertical \nAuthentication Bypass, \nSSRF, XXE, SQL Injection, \nUser Authentication \nBypass. \nHigh 3-7 daysHigh-risk vulnerabilities that could \nseriously affect security or business \noperations, but are less urgent than critical \nvulnerabilities. They still require swift \naction to prevent exploitation.\nVulnerabilities affecting \nthe platform's security \nand processes. \nLateral Authentication \nBypass, Stored XSS, some \nCSRF depending on \nimpact. \nMedium 15-30 daysModerate vulnerabilities that pose a risk \nbut require specific conditions to exploit, \nsuch as user interaction or specific \nconfigurations. These should be resolved \nwithin a month.\nVulnerabilities affecting \nmultiple users, requiring \nminimal user interaction \nto trigger. \nReflective XSS, Direct \nObject Reference, URL \nRedirect, some CSRF \ndepending on impact. \nLow 30-90 daysLow-risk vulnerabilities with minimal impact \nor requiring significant effort to exploit. \nThese can be addressed over a longer \nperiod but should still be tracked and \nresolved.\nIssues affecting singular \nusers, requiring \nsignificant interaction or \nprerequisites (e.g., MitM \nattacks). \nCommon flaws, Debug \nInformation, Mixed \nContent. \n\nremediated in a timely manner to minimize risks.\nRestrictions on Deployment: No software should be deployed to the production environment if it contains unresolved Critical or High \nfindings. An exception to this policy may be granted only if an approved Exception is in place, detailing compensating controls or \nacceptable risks for the specific case.\nResolution Methods: A vulnerability finding may be resolved by one of the following methods:\nFix/Mitigation: Providing and implementing a valid fix or mitigation that effectively addresses the identified vulnerability.\nFalse Positive: Determining that the finding is a false positive after proper validation, meaning the issue does not pose a real \nsecurity risk.\nApproved Exception: Documenting an approved exception, where a viable or immediate fix is not available, but compensating \ncontrols are in place to mitigate the risk.\nThis structured process ensures that vulnerabilities are systematically addressed, and that the organization remains protected from potential \nsecurity threats.\n3.9 Closing a Finding\nOnce a vulnerability finding has been addressed, the following steps must be followed to ensure proper closure:\nResolution and Comment: The assignee responsible for addressing the finding must provide a valid resolution, such as a fix, \nmitigation, or documented exception. A comment should be added to the finding in the tracking system detailing the resolution process.\nReassignment for Validation: After resolution, the finding should be re-assigned to the original Reporter or a designated member of the \nsecurity team for validation. This step ensures that the solution is reviewed and confirmed to have addressed the identified vulnerability.\nMarking the Finding as Closed: Upon successful validation by the security team or reporter, the finding can be marked as \"Done\" or \nclosed in the tracking system. However, before the finding is officially closed, the implemented fix must be deployed to a development \nenvironment for testing.\nProduction Release Planning: The final step before closure requires that the targeted release date for deploying the fix to the \nproduction environment is documented in the ticket. This ensures transparency and allows for tracking when the fix will be fully \nimplemented.\nThis process ensures that findings are not only resolved but also validated and tracked through to deployment, ensuring the security of \nsystems and compliance with internal standards.\n3.10 Exceptions\nIn certain cases, a viable or direct fix to a vulnerability may not be available. When this occurs, an Exception can be requested following the \nguidelines below:\nWhen to Request an Exception: An Exception may be necessary if the package version containing the fix is not supported on the \ncurrent operating system or if the fix introduces other technical constraints. \nCompensating Controls: In lieu of a direct fix, an alternative solution or compensating control must be implemented to mitigate the risk \nposed by the vulnerability. Compensating controls can be technical solutions or procedural changes and must address the original \nvulnerability effectively to lower the associated risk to an acceptable level.\nException Submission: The Exception must be formally requested through the tracking system (e.g., Jira) by creating a ticket \nspecifically for the Exception. The Exception ticket should include detailed information about why the vulnerability cannot be directly \naddressed, and a description of the compensating controls in place.\nReference to the Original Finding: The Exception ticket must be linked to the original vulnerability Finding by adding an Issue Link in \nthe tracking system, ensuring a clear connection between the two items.\nReview and Approval: Each Exception request must undergo a thorough review process. The Security Officer and the asset owner \nimpacted by the vulnerability must review and approve the Exception before it can be implemented. This ensures that the alternative \nsolution provides sufficient security and risk mitigation.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that all Exceptions are adequately documented, reviewed, and monitored, providing a controlled process \nfor managing vulnerabilities when a direct fix is not feasible.\n3.11 Malware Protection\nThe company will implement an anti-malware solution on all identified endpoints and system components at risk for malware. The anti-\nmalware solution will follow these guidelines:\nDetection and Removal: The anti-malware solution will be configured to detect all known types of malware and take appropriate \nactions, including removal, blocking, or containment of the malware to prevent damage or infection to company systems.\nAutomatic Updates: The anti-malware solution will be kept up-to-date automatically to ensure the system can defend against newly \nidentified threats.\nPeriodic and Real-Time Scanning: The anti-malware software will perform periodic scans and will continuously monitor the system via \nactive or real-time scanning. If behavioral analysis is implemented, it will monitor system processes for suspicious activities.\nRemovable Media Scans: When removable electronic media (e.g., USB drives) is inserted, connected, or logically mounted, the anti-\nmalware solution will automatically scan it for potential threats. If continuous behavioral analysis is enabled, the system will analyze the \nmedia for malware or other suspicious behavior throughout its use.\nAudit Logging: The anti-malware system will generate and retain audit logs of all malware scans, detections, and responses for a \nminimum period of 12 months. These logs will ensure traceability and monitoring of malware-related events.\nAccess Control: Configuration modifications to the anti-malware solution will be restricted to authorized personnel only. Regular users \nwill not be permitted to disable or alter the anti-malware protection mechanisms, except under specific circumstances where \nmanagement has documented and authorized an exception for a limited time.\nThe malware protection system will ensure comprehensive security by automating updates, scanning, and behavioral analysis. Controls \nover access to the anti-malware system will prevent unauthorized modifications, and audit logs will track system performance over time.\n3.12 Phishing Protection\nThe company will implement processes and automated mechanisms to detect and protect against phishing attacks aimed at personnel and \nsystems. The following measures will be included:\nEmail Security Protocols: Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) and DomainKeys Identified \nMail (DKIM) will be deployed to authenticate email origins and ensure that incoming emails are from trusted sources.\nLink Scrubbers: Automated systems will be used to scrub links within emails and web pages to detect and block malicious or suspicious \nURLs that may lead to phishing websites.\nServer-Side Antivirus: Server-side antivirus solutions will be used to scan emails and attachments before they reach user inboxes, \nreducing the risk of phishing and malware.\nContinuous Monitoring: Phishing detection systems will be continuously monitored to identify and respond to phishing attempts in real \ntime. Alerts and responses will be configured to mitigate risk and prevent users from interacting with phishing content.\nThe company will proactively guard against phishing attempts through automated email security protocols, link scrubbing technologies, and \nserver-side antivirus solutions. These mechanisms ensure the detection and mitigation of phishing threats before they reach personnel, \nenhancing overall cybersecurity.\n4 Document Administration\n4.1 Ownership and Review\n \nThe Document Owner owns this Document and is responsible for reviewing the Document for updates annually, or following any major \nchanges to Squirro AG's compliance environment.

These \nlogs must provide sufficient detail to answer the following questions:\nWhat activity was performed?\nWho performed the activity?\nWhere, when, and how was it performed (including the tools used)?\nWhat was the status, outcome, or result of the activity?\nBy ensuring that logs capture this information, the company enhances its ability to monitor, review, and respond to security events, ensuring \nthe integrity and security of its systems.\n3.2 Logged Activities\nLog records must be created for the following activities:\n\nSensitive Information Access:\nAttempts to create, read, update, or delete sensitive information, including confidential authentication data such as passwords.\nNetwork Connections:\nInitiating or accepting a network connection.\nUser Authentication and Authorization:\nUser login and logout, as well as any changes to access rights.\nInvalid Logical Access Attempts:\nAll unauthorized or failed logical access attempts.\nAdministrative Actions:\nAll actions performed by individuals with administrative or elevated privileges.\nAttempts to grant, modify, or revoke access rights (e.g., adding a new user or group, changing user privilege levels, modifying file or \ndatabase permissions).\nChanges to firewall rules, user privileges, and database object permissions.\nModifications of administrative access, including user password changes and elevation of privileges.\nAudit Log Access:\nAll access to audit logs, including actions such as starting, stopping, or pausing audit logs.\nSystem-Level Changes:\nCreation and deletion of system-level objects.\nChanges in system, network, or services configuration, including the installation of software patches, updates, or other installed \nsoftware modifications.\nSystem Events:\nApplication and process events, such as startup, shutdown, or restart.\nApplication process failure, abnormal termination, or resource exhaustion (e.g., CPU, memory, network bandwidth, disk space).\nFailures of critical services (e.g., DHCP, DNS), hardware faults, or hardware malfunctions.\nDetection of Suspicious/Malicious Activity:\nDetection and logging of potential security threats, including alerts from intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention \nsystems (IPS), web application firewalls, anti-malware systems, or anti-spyware tools.\nBy capturing these logged activities, the company ensures full visibility into system operations and enhances the ability to respond to \npotential security incidents or system malfunctions.\n3.3 Log Elements\nEach log must identify or contain the following elements to ensure thorough audit trails and log correlation where feasible (content may \ndepend on system):\nType of Action      The specific action performed, such as authorize, create, read, update, delete, or network connection \ninitiation. Includes whether the action was successful or failed. \nSubsystem           The process or transaction name responsible for performing the action. Examples include a system \nservice or application transaction. \nIdentifiers         Identifying information for the subject requesting the action, such as user name, computer name, IP \naddress, MAC address. These identifiers should be standardized for easy correlation. \nObject of Action    Identifies what the action was performed on, such as file names accessed, records from a database, or \nspecific network resources affected. \nElementDescription\n\nThis structured approach ensures that logs provide comprehensive visibility into system activities, enabling effective monitoring, auditing, \nand security investigations.\n3.4 Clock Synchronization\nTo ensure the accuracy of system logs, all system clocks must be synchronized using time-synchronization technology. The following \nrequirements are mandatory for maintaining the integrity and consistency of audit logs:\nTime Source: Logs must rely on accurate time sources, either International Atomic Time (TAI) or Coordinated Universal Time \n(UTC), to ensure uniformity across systems.\nNetwork Time Protocol (NTP): All servers and critical infrastructure must use NTP to synchronize their clocks with a central time server. \nThis ensures that the timestamps in audit logs are consistent across the environment.\nTime Synchronization Settings:\nAccess Control: Time synchronization settings will be restricted to authorized personnel only. Changes to the time settings must be \nlimited to those with a business need and appropriate permissions.\nLogging Changes: Any modification to time settings on critical systems must be logged, including details of the personnel making \nthe change and the reason for it.\nMonitoring: System logs must be continuously monitored to ensure that no unauthorized or unintended changes to the time settings \noccur. Any detected discrepancies will be flagged and reviewed.\nAuditing and Review: Regular reviews of time synchronization settings and logs will be conducted to detect any drift or misalignment in \ntime stamps, ensuring the accuracy of all logged events.\nThis synchronization mechanism helps ensure that all log entries are recorded with accurate and consistent timestamps, which is essential \nfor auditing, investigations, and compliance reporting.\n3.5 Protection of Audit Logs\nTo ensure the integrity and security of audit logs, the following controls will be implemented to safeguard logs from tampering by individuals \nwith elevated access or unauthorized users:\nAccess Control:\nRestricted Access: Read access to audit logs will be strictly limited to personnel with a job-related need. Only authorized \nindividuals responsible for monitoring or auditing system activity will be granted this access.\nAdministrator Restrictions: System administrators will be restricted from erasing, deactivating, or modifying logs of their own \nactivities if possible. This ensures transparency and accountability for administrative actions.\nBackup:\nCentralized Backup: All audit log files, including those related to external-facing technologies, will be backed up to a secure, \ncentralized internal log server or other secure media. These backups will be stored outside the direct control of system \nadministrators to prevent manipulation.\nRedundancy and Availability: Logs must be backed up on a regular basis, with redundancy measures in place to ensure log \navailability during recovery from failures or security incidents.\nBefore/After Values When applicable and feasible, records the before and after values of data elements that are updated as \npart of the action. \nDate and Time       The exact date and time the action was performed, including relevant time-zone information. For \nconsistency, logs should use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) when possible. \nAccess Control Outcome Whether the action was allowed or denied by the system's access control mechanisms. \nAccess Control Reason  In the event the action is denied, logs should contain descriptions or reason codes explaining why it \nwas blocked. \n\nFile Integrity Monitoring:\nChange Detection: A file integrity monitoring (FIM) or change-detection mechanism will be employed to monitor and protect audit \nlogs (where feasible based on system criticality, design and requirements). Any unauthorized or unexpected changes to the logs must \ngenerate real-time alerts.\nContinuous Monitoring: All log data will be subjected to continuous monitoring, with alerts configured to detect suspicious or \nmalicious activities targeting audit logs.\nReview and Accountability:\nPeriodic Reviews: Logs related to privileged user activities, including system administrators and operators, will be reviewed \nregularly to ensure compliance with security policies and detect any misuse or unauthorized actions.\nAccountability: All activities carried out by privileged users (e.g., system administrators) will be logged. These logs will be reviewed \nby security personnel and subjected to routine audits to maintain accountability.\nPrivileged Operations Logging:\nDelegated Operations: In instances where privileged operations have been delegated to the company by third parties or customers, \nthe performance of these operations will be logged and safeguarded. This ensures that all privileged actions are traceable and can \nbe audited when necessary.\nBy implementing these protections, the integrity and availability of audit logs are maintained, ensuring they provide reliable evidence for \naudits, investigations, and security monitoring.\n3.6 Monitoring\nFailures in critical security control systems must be detected, alerted, and resolved promptly to maintain the integrity of the company's \ninfrastructure. The systems that must be monitored include:\nNetwork Security Controls: \nIntrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): Monitors network traffic for suspicious activities and responds to threats.\nFirewalls: Ensures unauthorized network traffic is blocked, with real-time monitoring of firewall rule changes and suspicious \nconnection attempts.\nAccess Controls: \nPhysical Access Controls: Monitoring systems that track and alert on unauthorized physical access to sensitive areas such as data \ncenters (not applicable for cloud environment, maintained by cloud provider).\nLogical Access Controls: Ensuring that login attempts, failed logins, privilege escalations, and other access control mechanisms \nare actively monitored and alerting for unauthorized attempts.\nAudit Logs: \nAutomated Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of audit logs to detect anomalies, security breaches, and policy violations.\nPeriodic Reviews: Manual review of logs by authorized personnel to ensure adherence to company security policies and standards.\nChange Detection Mechanisms: \nFile Integrity Monitoring: Tracks and alerts on unauthorized changes to critical system files, configurations, and security settings.\nSystem Configuration Monitoring: Detects any unsanctioned system changes, such as unauthorized software installations or \nmisconfigurations.\nAnti-malware Solutions: \nThreat Detection: Continuous monitoring for malware infections, suspicious activity, and potential threats across systems, with \nautomatic alerts and incident reporting.\nFailures identified within any of these critical control systems must be addressed promptly in accordance with the incident response \npolicy.

These \nlogs must provide sufficient detail to answer the following questions:\nWhat activity was performed?\nWho performed the activity?\nWhere, when, and how was it performed (including the tools used)?\nWhat was the status, outcome, or result of the activity?\nBy ensuring that logs capture this information, the company enhances its ability to monitor, review, and respond to security events, ensuring \nthe integrity and security of its systems.\n3.2 Logged Activities\nLog records must be created for the following activities:\n\nSensitive Information Access:\nAttempts to create, read, update, or delete sensitive information, including confidential authentication data such as passwords.\nNetwork Connections:\nInitiating or accepting a network connection.\nUser Authentication and Authorization:\nUser login and logout, as well as any changes to access rights.\nInvalid Logical Access Attempts:\nAll unauthorized or failed logical access attempts.\nAdministrative Actions:\nAll actions performed by individuals with administrative or elevated privileges.\nAttempts to grant, modify, or revoke access rights (e.g., adding a new user or group, changing user privilege levels, modifying file or \ndatabase permissions).\nChanges to firewall rules, user privileges, and database object permissions.\nModifications of administrative access, including user password changes and elevation of privileges.\nAudit Log Access:\nAll access to audit logs, including actions such as starting, stopping, or pausing audit logs.\nSystem-Level Changes:\nCreation and deletion of system-level objects.\nChanges in system, network, or services configuration, including the installation of software patches, updates, or other installed \nsoftware modifications.\nSystem Events:\nApplication and process events, such as startup, shutdown, or restart.\nApplication process failure, abnormal termination, or resource exhaustion (e.g., CPU, memory, network bandwidth, disk space).\nFailures of critical services (e.g., DHCP, DNS), hardware faults, or hardware malfunctions.\nDetection of Suspicious/Malicious Activity:\nDetection and logging of potential security threats, including alerts from intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention \nsystems (IPS), web application firewalls, anti-malware systems, or anti-spyware tools.\nBy capturing these logged activities, the company ensures full visibility into system operations and enhances the ability to respond to \npotential security incidents or system malfunctions.\n3.3 Log Elements\nEach log must identify or contain the following elements to ensure thorough audit trails and log correlation where feasible (content may \ndepend on system):\nType of Action      The specific action performed, such as authorize, create, read, update, delete, or network connection \ninitiation. Includes whether the action was successful or failed. \nSubsystem           The process or transaction name responsible for performing the action. Examples include a system \nservice or application transaction. \nIdentifiers         Identifying information for the subject requesting the action, such as user name, computer name, IP \naddress, MAC address. These identifiers should be standardized for easy correlation. \nObject of Action    Identifies what the action was performed on, such as file names accessed, records from a database, or \nspecific network resources affected. \nElementDescription\n\nThis structured approach ensures that logs provide comprehensive visibility into system activities, enabling effective monitoring, auditing, \nand security investigations.\n3.4 Clock Synchronization\nTo ensure the accuracy of system logs, all system clocks must be synchronized using time-synchronization technology. The following \nrequirements are mandatory for maintaining the integrity and consistency of audit logs:\nTime Source: Logs must rely on accurate time sources, either International Atomic Time (TAI) or Coordinated Universal Time \n(UTC), to ensure uniformity across systems.\nNetwork Time Protocol (NTP): All servers and critical infrastructure must use NTP to synchronize their clocks with a central time server. \nThis ensures that the timestamps in audit logs are consistent across the environment.\nTime Synchronization Settings:\nAccess Control: Time synchronization settings will be restricted to authorized personnel only. Changes to the time settings must be \nlimited to those with a business need and appropriate permissions.\nLogging Changes: Any modification to time settings on critical systems must be logged, including details of the personnel making \nthe change and the reason for it.\nMonitoring: System logs must be continuously monitored to ensure that no unauthorized or unintended changes to the time settings \noccur. Any detected discrepancies will be flagged and reviewed.\nAuditing and Review: Regular reviews of time synchronization settings and logs will be conducted to detect any drift or misalignment in \ntime stamps, ensuring the accuracy of all logged events.\nThis synchronization mechanism helps ensure that all log entries are recorded with accurate and consistent timestamps, which is essential \nfor auditing, investigations, and compliance reporting.\n3.5 Protection of Audit Logs\nTo ensure the integrity and security of audit logs, the following controls will be implemented to safeguard logs from tampering by individuals \nwith elevated access or unauthorized users:\nAccess Control:\nRestricted Access: Read access to audit logs will be strictly limited to personnel with a job-related need. Only authorized \nindividuals responsible for monitoring or auditing system activity will be granted this access.\nAdministrator Restrictions: System administrators will be restricted from erasing, deactivating, or modifying logs of their own \nactivities if possible. This ensures transparency and accountability for administrative actions.\nBackup:\nCentralized Backup: All audit log files, including those related to external-facing technologies, will be backed up to a secure, \ncentralized internal log server or other secure media. These backups will be stored outside the direct control of system \nadministrators to prevent manipulation.\nRedundancy and Availability: Logs must be backed up on a regular basis, with redundancy measures in place to ensure log \navailability during recovery from failures or security incidents.\nBefore/After Values When applicable and feasible, records the before and after values of data elements that are updated as \npart of the action. \nDate and Time       The exact date and time the action was performed, including relevant time-zone information. For \nconsistency, logs should use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) when possible. \nAccess Control Outcome Whether the action was allowed or denied by the system's access control mechanisms. \nAccess Control Reason  In the event the action is denied, logs should contain descriptions or reason codes explaining why it \nwas blocked. \n\nFile Integrity Monitoring:\nChange Detection: A file integrity monitoring (FIM) or change-detection mechanism will be employed to monitor and protect audit \nlogs (where feasible based on system criticality, design and requirements). Any unauthorized or unexpected changes to the logs must \ngenerate real-time alerts.\nContinuous Monitoring: All log data will be subjected to continuous monitoring, with alerts configured to detect suspicious or \nmalicious activities targeting audit logs.\nReview and Accountability:\nPeriodic Reviews: Logs related to privileged user activities, including system administrators and operators, will be reviewed \nregularly to ensure compliance with security policies and detect any misuse or unauthorized actions.\nAccountability: All activities carried out by privileged users (e.g., system administrators) will be logged. These logs will be reviewed \nby security personnel and subjected to routine audits to maintain accountability.\nPrivileged Operations Logging:\nDelegated Operations: In instances where privileged operations have been delegated to the company by third parties or customers, \nthe performance of these operations will be logged and safeguarded. This ensures that all privileged actions are traceable and can \nbe audited when necessary.\nBy implementing these protections, the integrity and availability of audit logs are maintained, ensuring they provide reliable evidence for \naudits, investigations, and security monitoring.\n3.6 Monitoring\nFailures in critical security control systems must be detected, alerted, and resolved promptly to maintain the integrity of the company's \ninfrastructure. The systems that must be monitored include:\nNetwork Security Controls: \nIntrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): Monitors network traffic for suspicious activities and responds to threats.\nFirewalls: Ensures unauthorized network traffic is blocked, with real-time monitoring of firewall rule changes and suspicious \nconnection attempts.\nAccess Controls: \nPhysical Access Controls: Monitoring systems that track and alert on unauthorized physical access to sensitive areas such as data \ncenters (not applicable for cloud environment, maintained by cloud provider).\nLogical Access Controls: Ensuring that login attempts, failed logins, privilege escalations, and other access control mechanisms \nare actively monitored and alerting for unauthorized attempts.\nAudit Logs: \nAutomated Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of audit logs to detect anomalies, security breaches, and policy violations.\nPeriodic Reviews: Manual review of logs by authorized personnel to ensure adherence to company security policies and standards.\nChange Detection Mechanisms: \nFile Integrity Monitoring: Tracks and alerts on unauthorized changes to critical system files, configurations, and security settings.\nSystem Configuration Monitoring: Detects any unsanctioned system changes, such as unauthorized software installations or \nmisconfigurations.\nAnti-malware Solutions: \nThreat Detection: Continuous monitoring for malware infections, suspicious activity, and potential threats across systems, with \nautomatic alerts and incident reporting.\nFailures identified within any of these critical control systems must be addressed promptly in accordance with the incident response \npolicy. Actions include:\nRestoring Security Functions:\nSecurity functions must be immediately restored to minimize downtime and prevent further damage or compromise.\nDocumenting the Failure:\n\nDuration: Accurately recording the start and end times of the security failure.\nCause Identification: Investigating the root cause of the failure and documenting it comprehensively.\nAddressing Security Issues:\nImpact Assessment: Identifying and addressing any security risks or vulnerabilities exposed by the failure.\nRemediation: Implementing immediate fixes to resolve the issues, whether it is through patching, reconfiguring, or updating systems.\nEvaluating Future Risk:\nPreventative Actions: Implementing controls or improvements to prevent the reoccurrence of the failure.\nResuming Monitoring: Ensuring that the affected systems and controls are returned to full monitoring status to continue \nsafeguarding against future incidents.\nIncident Reporting:\nSecurity incidents resulting from control failures must be logged, reported, and shared with relevant stakeholders, including IT and \nsecurity teams, ensuring transparency and prompt action.\nBy enforcing continuous monitoring and establishing robust incident response mechanisms, the company ensures that failures in security \ncontrols are detected and addressed efficiently to minimize the impact on its operations and data security.\n4 Document Administration\n4.1 Ownership and Review\n  \n4.2 Monitoring and Enforcement\n4.3 Related Documents\n4.3.1 Internal documents\nInformation Security Policy \nInformation Security Organization Policy\nChange Management Policy \nConfiguration Management Plan  \n4.4 Approvals\nThe Document Owner owns this Document and is responsible for reviewing the Document for updates annually, or following any major \nchanges to Squirro AG's compliance environment.

This process will integrate information security at every stage to protect assets and \nmaintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\nStandardized Phases: Each software development project must follow defined SDLC phases: Determine System Need, Define System \nRequirements, Design System Components, Build System Components, Evaluate System Readiness, and System Deployment.\nIterative Cycles: Depending on the project management approach (Waterfall, Agile, Iterative), some SDLC phases can be combined or \niterated multiple times.\nSecure Engineering Principles: Security principles for business, data, application, and technology layers must be applied throughout \nthe SDLC to address risks identified via the company's information security risk assessments.\nThe company's SDLC ensures software development follows secure, standardized processes with integrated security measures at every \nstage, aligned with risk management strategies.\n3.2 Software Development Phases\nThe company's software development life cycle (SDLC) follows a structured approach consisting of several key phases, ensuring that both \nfunctional and security requirements are addressed at each step.\nDetermine System Need Phase: The initial phase where the system need is identified. During this phase, the business or technical \nneed for the system is evaluated, and resources are committed to address the requirement. This phase involves the identification of risks \nand opportunities for improving business processes through technology solutions.\nDefine System Requirements Phase: In this phase, user requirements are broken down into detailed technical specifications. Security \ncontrols and information security requirements are also identified through a risk assessment process. This ensures the system design \nincorporates adequate security measures to protect data and prevent vulnerabilities.\nDesign System Component Phase: The system's requirements are transformed into detailed specifications for system components. \nThe system's functional, interface, physical, and security requirements are fully defined during this stage. The design may be iterative, \nensuring that both functional and security considerations are revisited and updated.\nBuild System Component Phase: The system is constructed based on the design specifications. Each system component is coded, \ntested, and integrated with the larger system. Security testing is an integral part of this phase to identify and address potential \nvulnerabilities. Documentation for system installation, operations, and maintenance is also created during this phase.\nEvaluate System Readiness Phase: Independent testing is conducted to ensure that the system meets user requirements and security \nstandards. The system undergoes rigorous evaluation to measure performance, security, and overall readiness for deployment. This \nphase determines whether the system is ready to go live or if it requires redevelopment.\nSystem Deployment Phase: The system is deployed to an initial pilot site for further testing and then transitioned to the production \nenvironment. Training for users and administrators is completed in this phase to ensure proper operation of the system. Any remaining \nvulnerabilities identified during pilot testing are addressed before full-scale deployment.\n\nThe company's SDLC ensures that software projects move through well-defined phases, from initial need identification to deployment, with \nan emphasis on security and system readiness at each stage. By following this process, the company ensures the creation of secure, \nfunctional, and reliable software systems.\n3.3 Project Management\nThe sequence and structure of the software development phases depend on the specific project management approach selected for a given \nproject. Different methodologies can influence the way phases are implemented, including how they interact with one another and whether \nthey are completed sequentially or iteratively.\nWaterfall Development: This is a linear, sequential approach where each phase of the SDLC must be completed before moving on to \nthe next. It is often used for projects with well-defined requirements where changes are expected to be minimal during the development \nprocess.\nAgile Development: Agile development is a flexible, iterative approach that allows for continuous feedback and adaptation throughout \nthe project lifecycle. Small, functional increments of the software are developed and delivered in short cycles (sprints), enabling regular \nreview and adjustment.\nIterative Development: Iterative development allows for repeated cycles of development phases. The project moves through multiple \niterations of planning, design, development, and testing, refining the product in each iteration before arriving at the final release.\nStaged Delivery Development: This method focuses on delivering parts of the system incrementally in stages, with each stage \nrepresenting a functional subset of the final system. This approach allows parts of the system to be put into production early, providing \nvalue while subsequent stages are still in development.\nPhase Combination: Depending on the size and complexity of the software development project, some phases may be combined or \nrevisited. For example, in iterative development, multiple cycles of planning, design, development, and testing may occur before the final \nproduct is released.\nThe project management approach selected influences the sequence and flexibility of the development phases. Approaches such as Agile \nand Iterative Development enable more frequent feedback and adjustments, while Waterfall and Staged Delivery offer more structured, \nsequential development paths. By selecting the appropriate project management methodology, the company ensures that software \ndevelopment processes are both efficient and aligned with project needs.\n3.4 Secure System Engineering Principles\nInformation security implications must be considered throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Responsibilities for information \nsecurity must be clearly defined and allocated within the project management framework to ensure that security is embedded in every stage \nof development. The secure engineering principles are categorized into different layers, each with a focus on specific aspects of system \nsecurity.\n3.4.1 Business Layer\nThe Business Layer addresses the high-level requirements and ensures that security aligns with the company's objectives and risk \ntolerance.\nAlignment with Business Objectives: Ensure security measures align with business goals and risk management strategies.\nRisk Management: Identify and assess risks at each stage of the project and ensure that security controls address business-critical \nrisks.\nCompliance with Regulatory Requirements: Implement controls that ensure compliance with industry regulations (e.g., GDPR, \nHIPAA, ISO 27001).\nUser and Access Management: Ensure that access to systems and data is limited to authorized users based on business roles and \nresponsibilities.\n\n3.4.2 Data Layer\nThe Data Layer focuses on securing the data throughout its lifecycle, from creation to disposal.\nData Confidentiality: Protect sensitive data at rest and in transit using encryption methods that meet regulatory requirements (e.g., \nAES-256).\nData Integrity: Ensure that data is protected from unauthorized modification through hashing and integrity checks (e.g., HMAC, digital \nsignatures).\nData Availability: Implement redundancy and backup mechanisms to ensure data remains available in case of failure or disaster.\nData Minimization: Ensure that only necessary data is collected, retained, and processed, reducing exposure to potential data \nbreaches.\n3.4.3 Applications\nThe Application Layer involves designing and developing applications that are resilient to attacks and vulnerabilities.\nSecure Coding Practices: Use secure development practices, such as input validation, output encoding, and adherence to OWASP \nstandards, to prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).\nAuthentication and Authorization: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that \nonly authorized users can access the application.\nPatch Management: Ensure that applications are regularly updated and patched to address newly discovered vulnerabilities and \nthreats.\nApplication Security Testing: Conduct static and dynamic testing (e.g., SAST, DAST) to identify vulnerabilities before production \nrelease.\n3.4.4 Technology\nThe Technology Layer includes the technical infrastructure that supports the application and data, ensuring security at the network, \nsystem, and hardware levels.\nNetwork Security: Implement firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and network segmentation to protect \nagainst unauthorized access and lateral movement of threats.\nEndpoint Protection: Ensure that all endpoints (e.g., workstations, mobile devices) are equipped with security controls, such as anti-\nmalware tools, firewalls, and encryption.\nSecure Configuration: Apply secure configuration settings to operating systems, servers, and network devices, ensuring that default \nconfigurations are hardened.\nMonitoring and Logging: Implement continuous monitoring and logging of system events, network traffic, and application activity to \ndetect and respond to security incidents.\nThe secure system engineering principles aim to embed security across all layers of development, from business alignment to technology \ninfrastructure. By following these principles, the company ensures that information security is integrated into every aspect of system design, \ndevelopment, and operation.\n3.5 SDLC Security Control Guidelines\nThe company's Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process will adhere to robust security controls designed to safeguard information \nsystems and data. These controls will be applied throughout all phases of software development to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and \navailability of systems and data. \nSeparation of Duties: Adequate procedures must be established to ensure that duties related to the creation and approval of source \ndocuments are separated. Personnel assigned to the development/test environment must be different from those assigned to the \nproduction environment, ensuring clear segregation of responsibilities.\nChange Control Standard: All modifications to code or emergency releases must strictly follow the company's established change \ncontrol standard, ensuring proper documentation and approval of all changes before implementation.\n\nSecure Programming Standards: Secure coding practices must be followed in all software development activities to prevent common \nvulnerabilities and security risks. These practices must align with recognized frameworks such as OWASP and SANS.\nSecure Development Environment: The development environment must be designed and secured based on the following:\nData Sensitivity: The sensitivity of data being processed, stored, or transmitted must dictate the level of security in the development \nenvironment.\nCompliance: All internal and external regulatory requirements must be adhered to.\nPersonnel Trustworthiness: Only trusted and authorized personnel should have access to the development environment.\nOutsourcing Considerations: Security measures must account for the degree of outsourcing, if applicable, ensuring that external \nparties comply with the company's security policies.\nEnvironment Segregation: Development, test, and production environments must be clearly segregated to prevent unauthorized \naccess or data leakage between environments.\nAccess Controls: Access to the development environment must be controlled, logged, and monitored.\nChange Monitoring: All changes to the development environment and stored code must be monitored and audited.\nBackups: Data backups must be securely stored at offsite locations to ensure data availability in the event of a disaster.\nData Movement: Control over data movement to and from the development environment must be established to prevent \nunauthorized access or disclosure.\nThreat Modeling and Incident Reviews: Threat modeling must be conducted as part of the system design to identify and mitigate \npotential risks. Reviews of security incidents and contingency planning must also be in place to address vulnerabilities based on the \noperational environment.\nSecurity Vulnerabilities and Threat Prevention: All software deployed on corporate or hosted infrastructure must be designed to \nprevent security issues, including those outlined in OWASP and SANS. Static application security testing (SAST) or equivalent tools \nmust be used to detect vulnerabilities during the development process.\nCode Reviews: All code changes must undergo review by individuals other than the originating developer, with an emphasis on secure \ncoding practices. Reviews must be conducted by personnel knowledgeable in code review techniques and secure programming.\nOverrides and Approvals: Overrides of edit checks, approvals, and changes to confirmed transactions must be properly documented, \nauthorized, and reviewed.\nDevelopment and Production Environment Separation: Application development activities must be separated from production and \ntest environments, with enforced access controls. The extent of separation should be appropriate to the risk associated with the business \napplication and aligned with contractual requirements. Separation between production, development, and test environments should be \nevaluated regularly, and controls must be established to secure these environments.\nTest Environment Configuration: Test environments must mirror production environments as closely as possible to ensure accurate \ntesting outcomes and identify potential issues.\nChange Control in Production: All changes to production environments must adhere to the company's change control procedures. \nHuman approval from authorized individuals must be obtained for all changes. Automated updates should be disallowed without prior \napproval, and approval mechanisms must be enforced through automated systems wherever feasible (e.g., branch protection settings \non production code repositories).\nThe company's SDLC security controls are designed to ensure a secure, compliant, and well-managed development process. By following \nthese guidelines, the company safeguards its systems and data throughout the entire software development lifecycle.\n3.6 Secure Software Development Training and Practices\nThe company requires all personnel involved in supporting or writing bespoke or custom software to complete annual security training that \nfocuses on secure coding practices. This is particularly important for individuals involved in developing or supporting internet-facing \napplications, where specific threats related to online vulnerabilities are more prevalent.\nAnnual Security Training: All individuals writing or supporting custom software must complete secure coding training annually. This \ntraining must be completed prior to engaging in any software development or support activities. The training will include the most recent \nOWASP secure development principles and awareness of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.\n\nSpecialized Internet Threat Training: For those supporting or writing internet-facing applications, additional training must cover security \nthreats that are specific to the web, including techniques for defending against common internet-based attacks.\nAccount and Credential Security: Custom accounts, user IDs, and passwords must be removed from all applications before they are \ndeployed or released to customers to avoid potential backdoor vulnerabilities.\nProhibition on Production Data in Testing: Production data should not be used in development or test environments. Testing must be \nconducted with anonymized or synthetic data to prevent unauthorized exposure of sensitive information.\nProduction Quality Controls in Test Systems: Security controls applied to the production environment must be mirrored in test \nenvironments to ensure consistency. The test environment should match the production environment as closely as possible to simulate \nreal-world conditions while maintaining security.\nQuality Assurance (QA) Testing: QA processes prior to the release of new features must include thorough testing of user input \nconstraints. This testing must cover edge and boundary cases to identify potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited through \nunexpected user behavior.\nThe company mandates comprehensive secure coding training and practices to ensure that software development and support activities \nadhere to the highest standards of security. By focusing on secure development principles, mirroring production controls, and emphasizing \nrigorous QA testing, the company minimizes the risk of vulnerabilities in its applications.\n3.7 Production Data Use in Testing\nIn situations where production data must be used for testing purposes, stringent controls must be followed to ensure the confidentiality, \nintegrity, and security of the data. The following requirements outline the process for safely handling production data during testing:\nApproval Requirement: The Information Resource Owner must provide explicit approval before production data can be used in any \ntesting environment.\nData Anonymization: Wherever possible, production data should be tokenized, anonymized, removed, or de-identified to avoid \nexposing sensitive information during the testing process.\nSeparation of Data: Testing and parallel runs must use a separate copy of production data, and the test location must meet security \nstandards (e.g., loading confidential production data onto unsecured devices such as laptops is prohibited).\nRestricted Handling: Production data must not be extracted, handled, or used in a way that exposes it to unauthorized access. Data \nhandling must follow strict protocols to prevent unauthorized disclosure.\nAccess Control: Only personnel with a documented business need may access production data for testing, and access must follow the \nsame control procedures as those used in operational environments.\nAuthorization for Test Data: Each instance of copying operational data to a test environment must receive separate authorization, \nensuring that only necessary data is transferred.\nAudit Logging: All instances of copying production data into a test environment must be logged, and audit trails must be maintained for \nfuture review.\nLimited Access: Production data must be restricted to users with a documented business need, and only the necessary information \nshould be accessible to those users. The access control process must ensure that only authorized personnel are permitted to interact \nwith the data.\nData Erasure: Production data used for testing purposes must be securely erased once testing is complete to prevent any further \naccess or exposure.\nTest Data Removal: All test data and user accounts created during the testing phase must be removed prior to the system's deployment \ninto a production environment.\nData Encryption: Any Restricted or Protected Information used in testing must be encrypted according to the company's Encryption \nStandard, both while at rest and during transit.\nUsing production data for testing purposes must be strictly controlled. Approval from the Information Resource Owner is required, and data \nmust be anonymized or tokenized wherever feasible. Only authorized personnel can access production data, and all data transfers must be \nlogged for auditing. Data must be securely erased upon completion of testing, ensuring sensitive information remains protected.\n\n3.8 Outsourced Production Security Requirements\nWhen production is outsourced, the company must implement stringent controls across the entire external supply chain. These controls are \ndesigned to ensure compliance with security, quality, and contractual obligations, in conjunction with the requirements outlined in the Vendor \nManagement Policy.\nLicensing and Intellectual Property: Licensing arrangements, code ownership, and intellectual property rights related to outsourced \ncontent must be clearly defined and agreed upon.

This includes obtaining \nconsent from the vendor and assessing the risk of compromising built-in controls and integrity processes.\nRisk of modification: If modifications to vendor software are necessary, the potential impact on security, functionality, and compatibility \nwith existing systems must be carefully analyzed.\nVendor updates: Whenever possible, the company should rely on vendor-provided standard updates to avoid assuming the \nresponsibility of maintaining custom modifications. Vendor-supplied changes should be treated as part of the overall change \nmanagement process.\nBy carefully managing vendor-supplied software and services, the company can ensure that security and compatibility are maintained \nwithout unnecessary customization that may lead to future support challenges.\n\n3.5 Planned Changes\nPlanned changes must be managed through a structured process that ensures alignment with business objectives and minimal impact on \noperations.\nPlan implementation: For each planned change, a detailed implementation plan must be created. The plan should outline the tasks, \nresponsibilities, deadlines, and resources required to complete the change.\nAssign roles and deadlines: Clearly assign roles and responsibilities to team members involved in the change, ensuring that all \ndeadlines are met.\nMonitor execution: Monitor the implementation of changes to confirm that they are executed according to the plan, minimizing \ndisruption to business processes and ensuring successful outcomes.\nPlanned changes should be executed in a controlled, predictable manner to ensure that they align with business goals while maintaining \nsystem stability.\n3.6 Unplanned Changes and Emergency Changes\nUnplanned or emergency changes must follow an expedited process while maintaining a focus on risk mitigation and system stability.\nReview unplanned changes: Any unintended changes must be reviewed for their consequences and potential for adverse effects. \nImmediate corrective actions should be planned and implemented as necessary.\nEmergency changes: In cases where critical vulnerabilities are discovered, emergency changes may be required. Such changes can \nbypass normal procedures to address the immediate threat, but they must still be documented, tested as thoroughly as possible, and \nformally reviewed afterward.\nEvaluate after action: After any emergency change, a post-implementation review must be conducted to assess its effectiveness and \nany potential side effects or risks introduced during the process.\nThese procedures ensure that unplanned and emergency changes are handled swiftly but securely, preventing any unnecessary risks while \nrestoring normal operations.\n3.7 Configuration Management Requirements\nConfiguration management ensures that production systems and network changes are tracked, documented, and controlled to maintain \noperational security and integrity.\nStandardization and Automation: Tools such as Terraform and Ansible will be used to standardize and automate configuration \nmanagement processes.\nApproval of Deployments: No system will be deployed without approval from the CIO. All changes to production systems, network \ndevices, and firewalls must be approved by the CIO to ensure compliance with business and security requirements.\nTesting Changes: All changes to production systems must be thoroughly tested before implementation to ensure they function as \nexpected without introducing risks.\nUp-to-date Inventory: A system for generating an up-to-date inventory of all systems and related products and services must be \nmaintained, including corresponding architecture diagrams.\nSeparation of Frontend and Backend: All frontend functionality (e.g., developer dashboards) must be separated from backend \nsystems (e.g., databases and app servers), which are deployed on separate servers or containers.\nReview of Code: All committed code must be reviewed using pull requests to ensure code quality and proactively detect security issues \nduring development.\nStaging Environments: Development and staging environments must mirror production to ensure proper functionality before changes \nare moved into production.\nConfiguration management ensures that all system changes are controlled, tested, and documented to maintain system integrity and \nsecurity.\n\n3.8 Change Security Measures\nAll changes must comply with the security standards defined by company to ensure system protection and operational integrity.\nBranch Protection Rules: GitHub branch protection rules must be enforced to ensure only approved changes reach production.\nSecurity Review: Significant changes must be reviewed and approved by the security team.\nDeployment of Changes: Changes must only be deployed to production by authorized personnel with elevated privileges.\nPost-Deployment Testing: Post-deployment QA testing must be conducted to ensure that changes are functioning as intended and do \nnot introduce new security vulnerabilities.\nThese measures ensure that all changes to company's systems are implemented securely and effectively, reducing the risk of security \nbreaches.\n4 Document Administration\n4.1 Ownership and Review\n  \n4.2 Monitoring and Enforcement\n4.3 Related Documents\n4.3.1 Internal documents\nInformation Security Policy \nInformation Security Organization Policy\n4.4 Approvals\n4.5 Revision History\nFollow the link for details of revisions. \nThe Document Owner owns this Document and is responsible for reviewing the Document for updates annually, or following any major \nchanges to Squirro AG's compliance environment.

Checkstep will manage all system and application changes\nsubject to this policy (e.g. operating system, computing hardware, networks, applications, data centers) in accordance\nwith the applicable change management procedures.\nProcedures\nThe objective of this process is to manage the introduction of any change into production by ensuring that the correct\nprocedures are being followed, proper documentation has been completed, proper testing has been performed, and\nproper approval is in place.\nOrganizational Change Control\nThe following procedures apply to all changes, including infrastructure, code, and networking changes, as well as the\ndeployment of new hardware:\n•A record of agreed authorization levels will be maintained.\n•Changes are only submitted by authorized users.\n•Controls and integrity procedures will be reviewed to ensure that they will not be compromised by the\nchanges.\n•Security critical code to minimize the likelihood of known security weaknesses will be identified and\nchecked.\n•Formal approval must be obtained for detailed proposals before work begins.\n•Changes will be implemented at a time that is least intrusive to business processes involved.\n•Vendor-supplied software will be used without modification; in the event that a modification is necessary, the\nfollowing will be evaluated:\n◦Risk of compromising built-in controls and integrity processes\n◦Vendor consent\n◦Getting the modifications from vendor as standard updates\n◦Impact of owning the responsibility for maintaining the program\n◦Compatibility with other software in use.\n•A technical review of applications will be conducted after changes to operating platforms (operating systems,\ndatabases and middleware platforms). The review will include:\n\n◦Application control and integrity procedures to ensure that they have not been compromised by the\noperating platform changes.\n◦Timely notification of operating platform changes to allow appropriate tests and reviews to take\nplace before implementation.\n◦Appropriate changes are made to the business continuity plans.\n•Customers must be notified of major changes (new subprocessor, etc.) or changes that may lead to system\ndowntime, at least 2 business days prior to their deployment to the production environment.\nPlanned Changes\nFor planned changes, Checkstep will:\n•Plan the implementation and assign tasks, responsibilities, deadlines and resources using the internal changes\ntracking system;\n•For the significant changes that impact the product on a deeper level the Architecture Decision Record (ADR)\nwill be filed in the ADR catalog;\n•Implement changes according to the plan;\n•Monitor the implementation to confirm that they are implemented according to the plan.\nUnplanned Changes\nFor observed unintended changes, Checkstep will:\n•Review consequences of the changes;\n•Evaluate the occurrence or potential for occurrence of any adverse effects;\n•Plan and implement actions to mitigate any adverse effects as necessary;\n•In the case of Emergency Changes (e.g., when a critical vulnerability is discovered and needs to be resolved\nimmediately), an expedited process may be conducted.\nSoftware Development\nFor software development, operating system applications and software changes will only be implemented after\nextensive and successful testing:\n•The tests will cover:\n◦Usability\n◦Security\n◦Effects on other systems\n◦Tests will be conducted on separate systems (test environment), and all corresponding program\nsource libraries will also be updated, as appropriate.\n•The operational software, applications and program libraries of Checkstep will only be updated by trained\nadministrators upon appropriate management authorization.\n•Company operational systems will only hold approved executable code, not development code or compilers.\n•A configuration control system will be used to keep control of all implemented software as well as the system\ndocumentation.\n◦Previous versions of software will be retained as a contingency measure.\n◦Old versions of software will be archived, together with all required information and parameters,\nprocedures, configuration details and supporting software for as long as the data are retained in the\narchive.\n•There will be a rollback strategy in place before changes are implemented.\n•An audit log will be maintained of all updates to operational program libraries.\n\nVersionDateEditorDescription of Changes\n•All decisions to upgrade to a new version release must take into account:\n◦Business requirements for the change\n◦Security of the release, e.g. the introduction of new information security functionality or the number\nand severity of information security problems affecting this version.\n•Change security measures will be in place, to include:\n◦Branch protection rules (Gitlab);\n◦Review & approval from the security team in case of significant changes;\n◦Changes deployed to production only by specifically authorized personnel with escalated privileges;\nand,\n◦Post deployment QA testing to ensure the change is functioning as intended in the production\nenvironment.\nSupplier Services\nManagement of changes to supplier services is covered in theVendor Management Policyin the Policy Center.\nConfiguration Management\nFor configuration management, production and system network changes will only be implemented with properly\nconducted procedures:\n•Terraform and Gitlab are used to standardize and automate configuration management.\n•No systems are deployed into Checkstep environments without approval of the Checkstep CTO or\nEngineering Manager.\n•All changes to production systems, network devices, and firewalls are approved by the Checkstep Checkstep\nCTO or Engineering Manager before they are implemented to assure they comply with business and security\nrequirements.\n•All changes to production systems are tested before they are implemented in production.\n•Implementation of approved changes are only performed by authorized personnel.\n•Tooling to generate an up-to-date inventory of systems, including corresponding architecture diagrams for\nrelated products and services, is hosted on Gitlab in the form of Terraform Code.\n•All frontend functionality (developer dashboards and portals) is separated from backend (database and app\nservers) systems by being deployed on separate servers or containers.\n•All committed code is reviewed using pull requests to assure software code quality and proactively detect\npotential security issues in development.\n•Checkstep utilizes development and staging environments that mirror production to assure proper function.\n•All formal change requests require unique ID and authentication.\n•Identities assigned to multiple persons (e.g. shared identities) are only permitted where they are necessary for\nbusiness or operational reasons and are subject to dedicated approval and documentation.\n•Clocks are continuously synchronized to an authoritative source across all systems using a single reference\ntime source. Modifying time data on systems is restricted.\nRevision History\n\n1.0January 19, 2023Vilius PankauskasInitial Creation\n1.1May 2nd, 2023Vilius PankauskasEdits to match the process of Checkstep\n1.112-Nov-2024Vilius Pankauskasno changes\n\nPolicy version history\nPolicy details\nPolicy name\nChange Management Policy\nRenewal date\nDecember 1, 2025\nDescription\nThis policy establishes the company's processes to manage changes across the organization in a well-communicated, planned and\npredictable manner that minimizes unplanned outages and unforeseen system issues.\nVersion history\nVersion 1\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nJanuary 12, 2023-Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas\nVersion 2\nExplanation of changes\nNew policy with the edits to match the existing Checkstep process\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nMay 2, 2023May 2, 2023Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas\nVersion 3\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 12, 2024November 18, 2024Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"result\": \"Valid\",\n  \"details\": []\n}"}]}

Checkstep will manage all system and application changes\nsubject to this policy (e.g. operating system, computing hardware, networks, applications, data centers) in accordance\nwith the applicable change management procedures.\nProcedures\nThe objective of this process is to manage the introduction of any change into production by ensuring that the correct\nprocedures are being followed, proper documentation has been completed, proper testing has been performed, and\nproper approval is in place.\nOrganizational Change Control\nThe following procedures apply to all changes, including infrastructure, code, and networking changes, as well as the\ndeployment of new hardware:\n•A record of agreed authorization levels will be maintained.\n•Changes are only submitted by authorized users.\n•Controls and integrity procedures will be reviewed to ensure that they will not be compromised by the\nchanges.\n•Security critical code to minimize the likelihood of known security weaknesses will be identified and\nchecked.\n•Formal approval must be obtained for detailed proposals before work begins.\n•Changes will be implemented at a time that is least intrusive to business processes involved.\n•Vendor-supplied software will be used without modification; in the event that a modification is necessary, the\nfollowing will be evaluated:\n◦Risk of compromising built-in controls and integrity processes\n◦Vendor consent\n◦Getting the modifications from vendor as standard updates\n◦Impact of owning the responsibility for maintaining the program\n◦Compatibility with other software in use.\n•A technical review of applications will be conducted after changes to operating platforms (operating systems,\ndatabases and middleware platforms). The review will include:\n\n◦Application control and integrity procedures to ensure that they have not been compromised by the\noperating platform changes.\n◦Timely notification of operating platform changes to allow appropriate tests and reviews to take\nplace before implementation.\n◦Appropriate changes are made to the business continuity plans.\n•Customers must be notified of major changes (new subprocessor, etc.) or changes that may lead to system\ndowntime, at least 2 business days prior to their deployment to the production environment.\nPlanned Changes\nFor planned changes, Checkstep will:\n•Plan the implementation and assign tasks, responsibilities, deadlines and resources using the internal changes\ntracking system;\n•For the significant changes that impact the product on a deeper level the Architecture Decision Record (ADR)\nwill be filed in the ADR catalog;\n•Implement changes according to the plan;\n•Monitor the implementation to confirm that they are implemented according to the plan.\nUnplanned Changes\nFor observed unintended changes, Checkstep will:\n•Review consequences of the changes;\n•Evaluate the occurrence or potential for occurrence of any adverse effects;\n•Plan and implement actions to mitigate any adverse effects as necessary;\n•In the case of Emergency Changes (e.g., when a critical vulnerability is discovered and needs to be resolved\nimmediately), an expedited process may be conducted.\nSoftware Development\nFor software development, operating system applications and software changes will only be implemented after\nextensive and successful testing:\n•The tests will cover:\n◦Usability\n◦Security\n◦Effects on other systems\n◦Tests will be conducted on separate systems (test environment), and all corresponding program\nsource libraries will also be updated, as appropriate.\n•The operational software, applications and program libraries of Checkstep will only be updated by trained\nadministrators upon appropriate management authorization.\n•Company operational systems will only hold approved executable code, not development code or compilers.\n•A configuration control system will be used to keep control of all implemented software as well as the system\ndocumentation.\n◦Previous versions of software will be retained as a contingency measure.\n◦Old versions of software will be archived, together with all required information and parameters,\nprocedures, configuration details and supporting software for as long as the data are retained in the\narchive.\n•There will be a rollback strategy in place before changes are implemented.\n•An audit log will be maintained of all updates to operational program libraries.\n\nVersionDateEditorDescription of Changes\n•All decisions to upgrade to a new version release must take into account:\n◦Business requirements for the change\n◦Security of the release, e.g. the introduction of new information security functionality or the number\nand severity of information security problems affecting this version.\n•Change security measures will be in place, to include:\n◦Branch protection rules (Gitlab);\n◦Review & approval from the security team in case of significant changes;\n◦Changes deployed to production only by specifically authorized personnel with escalated privileges;\nand,\n◦Post deployment QA testing to ensure the change is functioning as intended in the production\nenvironment.\nSupplier Services\nManagement of changes to supplier services is covered in theVendor Management Policyin the Policy Center.\nConfiguration Management\nFor configuration management, production and system network changes will only be implemented with properly\nconducted procedures:\n•Terraform and Gitlab are used to standardize and automate configuration management.\n•No systems are deployed into Checkstep environments without approval of the Checkstep CTO or\nEngineering Manager.\n•All changes to production systems, network devices, and firewalls are approved by the Checkstep Checkstep\nCTO or Engineering Manager before they are implemented to assure they comply with business and security\nrequirements.\n•All changes to production systems are tested before they are implemented in production.\n•Implementation of approved changes are only performed by authorized personnel.\n•Tooling to generate an up-to-date inventory of systems, including corresponding architecture diagrams for\nrelated products and services, is hosted on Gitlab in the form of Terraform Code.\n•All frontend functionality (developer dashboards and portals) is separated from backend (database and app\nservers) systems by being deployed on separate servers or containers.\n•All committed code is reviewed using pull requests to assure software code quality and proactively detect\npotential security issues in development.\n•Checkstep utilizes development and staging environments that mirror production to assure proper function.\n•All formal change requests require unique ID and authentication.\n•Identities assigned to multiple persons (e.g. shared identities) are only permitted where they are necessary for\nbusiness or operational reasons and are subject to dedicated approval and documentation.\n•Clocks are continuously synchronized to an authoritative source across all systems using a single reference\ntime source. Modifying time data on systems is restricted.\nRevision History\n\n1.0January 19, 2023Vilius PankauskasInitial Creation\n1.1May 2nd, 2023Vilius PankauskasEdits to match the process of Checkstep\n1.112-Nov-2024Vilius Pankauskasno changes\n\nPolicy version history\nPolicy details\nPolicy name\nChange Management Policy\nRenewal date\nDecember 1, 2025\nDescription\nThis policy establishes the company's processes to manage changes across the organization in a well-communicated, planned and\npredictable manner that minimizes unplanned outages and unforeseen system issues.\nVersion history\nVersion 1\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nJanuary 12, 2023-Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas\nVersion 2\nExplanation of changes\nNew policy with the edits to match the existing Checkstep process\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nMay 2, 2023May 2, 2023Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas\nVersion 3\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 12, 2024November 18, 2024Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"result\": \"Valid\",\n  \"details\": []\n}"}]}

Applicable security requirements and controls\nwill be identified through an information security risk assessment.\nDesign System Component Phase\nThe Design System Components phase transforms requirements into specifications to guide the work of the\nDevelopment phase. The decisions made in this phase address how the system will meet the functional, physical,\ninterface, data, and security requirements. Design phase activities may be conducted in an iterative fashion, producing a\nsystem design that emphasizes the functional features of the system and technical detail.\nBuild System Component Phase\nThe Build phase transforms the detailed system design into complete coded software units and eventually, into an\nintegrated product for release. Each software unit and subsequent integrated units are tested thoroughly, to include tests\nfor security vulnerabilities. System documents that support installation and operations are also developed in this phase.\nEvaluate System Readiness Phase\nThe evaluation phase ensures that the system, as designed and built, satisfies the requirements of the user, as well as\napplicable security requirements. Whenever possible, independent testers measure the system's ability to perform the\nfunctions that are required by the customer and ensure an acceptable level of quality, performance, and security. Once\nthe phase is complete, it will be evident whether or not the system is ready for operation or redevelopment.\nSystem Deployment Phase\nSystem Deployment phase is the final phase of the development life cycle, when the system is released initially to a\npilot site, where any further security vulnerabilities can be identified, and then into the production environment. All\nnecessary training for using the system is accomplished.\nProject Management\nThe sequence of the development phases depends on the software development approach taken. The project\nmanagement approaches include but are not limited to:\n•Waterfall Development\n•Agile Development\n•Iterative Development\n•Staged Delivery Development\nBased on the approach for and the size of the software development, some of the phases can be combined. In Iterative\nDevelopment there may be multiple Cycles (iterations) of the above phases before the final software is released.\nManaging Test Information\nTest data must be carefully managed to ensure it does not compromise the security, privacy, or integrity of production\nenvironments. Under no circumstances should test information, such as test accounts, data, or configurations, be\ndeployed to production environments. If test data or accounts are inadvertently introduced into production, they must\nbe promptly identified and securely removed. Testing activities should always utilize dedicated environments separate\nfrom production, and production-like security controls must be implemented in test environments to safeguard sensitive\ndata. Where the use of production data in testing is unavoidable, it must be approved by the Information Resource\nOwner, anonymized or tokenized wherever feasible, and securely deleted after testing is completed.\n\nSecure System Engineering Principles\nInformation security implications will be addressed and reviewed regularly, and responsibilities for information security\nwill be defined and allocated to the roles defined in the project management methods.\nSDLC Security Control Guidelines\nThe SDLC process will adhere to the following information security controls:\n•Adequate procedures should be established to provide separation of duties in the origination and approval of\nsource documents. This shall include but not be limited to separation of duties between Personnel assigned to\nthe development/test environment and those assigned to the production environment.\n•Modification of code or an emergency release will follow the change control standard.\n•Secure programming standards should be followed. Secure code training should be provided to Checkstep's\ndevelopers.\n•Secure development environment will be created, based on:\n◦sensitivity of data to be processed, stored and transmitted by the system;\n◦applicable external and internal requirements, e.g. from regulations or policies;\n◦security controls already implemented by the organization that support system development;\n◦trustworthiness of personnel working in the environment;\n◦the degree of outsourcing associated with system development;\n◦the need for segregation between different development environments;\n◦control of access to the development environment;\n◦monitoring of change to the environment and code stored therein;\n◦backups are stored at secure offsite locations; and,\n◦control over movement of data from and to the environment.\n•All software deployed on Corporate or Hosted infrastructure must prevent security issues including but not\nlimited to those covered by the best practices SANS and OWASP for the secure development of software.\n•Code changes are reviewed by individuals other than the originating code author and by individuals who are\nknowledgeable in code review techniques and secure coding practices.\n•Overrides of edit checks, approvals, and changes to confirmed transactions should be appropriately\nauthorized, documented, and reviewed.\n•Application development activity should be separated from the production and test environments. The extent\nof separation, logical or physical, is recommended to be appropriate to the risk of the business application or\nbe in line with customer contractual requirements. The level of separation that is necessary between\nproduction, development, and test environments should be evaluated and controls established to secure that\nseparation.\n•All changes to production environments should strictly follow change control procedures, including human\napproval of all changes, granted by an authorized owner of that environment. Automated updates should be\ndisallowed without such approval.\n•Active production environments should not be re-used as test environments. Inactive and/or decommissioned\nproduction environments should not be used as test environments unless all private data has been removed.\nTest environments should not be re-used as production environments without going through a\ndecommissioning and recommissioning process that cleans all remnants of test data, tools, etc.\n•Individuals who are responsible for supporting or writing code for an internet-facing application, or internal\napplication that utilizes web technology and handles customer information, should complete annual security\ntraining specific to secure coding practices. For individuals supporting or writing code for an internet-facing\napplication, training should also include topics specific to internet threats. The individual should complete the\ntraining prior to writing or supporting the code. The training must include OWASP secure development\nprinciples as well as OWASP top 10 vulnerability awareness for the most recent year available.\n•Custom accounts and user IDs and/or passwords should be removed from applications before applications\nbecome active or are released to customers.\n•Production data should not be used in testing or development environments.\n•Security controls that are in place for the production copy in the test system should be production quality (e.g.\nmirroring the production controls over the data).\n\nFor situations demonstrating that testing needs to use production data, the requirements are the following:\n•The Information Resource Owner will provide approval before production data can be used for testing\npurposes.\n•Wherever possible, the production data should be tokenized or anonymized instead of using production data.\n•Testing and parallel runs should use a separate copy of production data and the test location or destination\nshould be acceptable (e.g. loading confidential production data to a laptop for testing is not acceptable).\n•The data should not be extracted, handled, or used by the test process in a manner that subjects the data to\nunauthorized disclosure.\n•The data should be accessed on a need-to-know basis.\n•Normal test activities should not use production data. In cases where test activity requires access to\nproduction data, access to production data should be restricted to only those individuals who have a\ndocumented business need. Only the information with the documented business need should be accessible by\nthose users.\n•Production data used for testing should be securely erased upon completion of testing.\n•Test data and accounts will be removed before being placed into production.\n•Restricted/Protected Information will be encrypted according to the Encryption Standard while at rest or in\ntransit.\n•Error messages must be handled securely and they must not leak sensitive information.\nRevision History\nVersionDateEditorDescription of Changes\n1.17th Nov 2023Vilius PankauskasInitial Creation\n1.118 Nov 2024Vilius Pankauskasno changes\n\nPolicy version history\nPolicy details\nPolicy name\nSoftware Development Life Cycle Policy\nRenewal date\nDecember 1, 2025\nDescription\nThis policy defines the high-level requirements for providing business program managers, business project managers, technical project\nmanagers, and other program and project stakeholders guidance to support the approval, planning, and life cycle development of the\ncompany's software systems.\nVersion history\nVersion 1\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nAugust 28, 2021December 14, 2021Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 2\nExplanation of changes\nThe change management is now in Operations Security Policy\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nFebruary 2, 2022February 10, 2022Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 3\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 28, 2022November 28, 2022Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 4\n\nExplanation of changes\nyearly policies review\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 30, 2023December 1, 2023Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 5\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 18, 2024November 20, 2024Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"result\": \"Invalid\",\n  \"details\": [\n    {\n      \"control\": \"A.8.28 Secure coding\",\n      \"issue\": \"This policy specifically designed for rules in the development life cycle of the company software; there are no things related to secure coding.

Checkstep will manage all system and application changes\nsubject to this policy (e.g. operating system, computing hardware, networks, applications, data centers) in accordance\nwith the applicable change management procedures.\nProcedures\nThe objective of this process is to manage the introduction of any change into production by ensuring that the correct\nprocedures are being followed, proper documentation has been completed, proper testing has been performed, and\nproper approval is in place.\nOrganizational Change Control\nThe following procedures apply to all changes, including infrastructure, code, and networking changes, as well as the\ndeployment of new hardware:\n•A record of agreed authorization levels will be maintained.\n•Changes are only submitted by authorized users.\n•Controls and integrity procedures will be reviewed to ensure that they will not be compromised by the\nchanges.\n•Security critical code to minimize the likelihood of known security weaknesses will be identified and\nchecked.\n•Formal approval must be obtained for detailed proposals before work begins.\n•Changes will be implemented at a time that is least intrusive to business processes involved.\n•Vendor-supplied software will be used without modification; in the event that a modification is necessary, the\nfollowing will be evaluated:\n◦Risk of compromising built-in controls and integrity processes\n◦Vendor consent\n◦Getting the modifications from vendor as standard updates\n◦Impact of owning the responsibility for maintaining the program\n◦Compatibility with other software in use.\n•A technical review of applications will be conducted after changes to operating platforms (operating systems,\ndatabases and middleware platforms). The review will include:\n\n◦Application control and integrity procedures to ensure that they have not been compromised by the\noperating platform changes.\n◦Timely notification of operating platform changes to allow appropriate tests and reviews to take\nplace before implementation.\n◦Appropriate changes are made to the business continuity plans.\n•Customers must be notified of major changes (new subprocessor, etc.) or changes that may lead to system\ndowntime, at least 2 business days prior to their deployment to the production environment.\nPlanned Changes\nFor planned changes, Checkstep will:\n•Plan the implementation and assign tasks, responsibilities, deadlines and resources using the internal changes\ntracking system;\n•For the significant changes that impact the product on a deeper level the Architecture Decision Record (ADR)\nwill be filed in the ADR catalog;\n•Implement changes according to the plan;\n•Monitor the implementation to confirm that they are implemented according to the plan.\nUnplanned Changes\nFor observed unintended changes, Checkstep will:\n•Review consequences of the changes;\n•Evaluate the occurrence or potential for occurrence of any adverse effects;\n•Plan and implement actions to mitigate any adverse effects as necessary;\n•In the case of Emergency Changes (e.g., when a critical vulnerability is discovered and needs to be resolved\nimmediately), an expedited process may be conducted.\nSoftware Development\nFor software development, operating system applications and software changes will only be implemented after\nextensive and successful testing:\n•The tests will cover:\n◦Usability\n◦Security\n◦Effects on other systems\n◦Tests will be conducted on separate systems (test environment), and all corresponding program\nsource libraries will also be updated, as appropriate.\n•The operational software, applications and program libraries of Checkstep will only be updated by trained\nadministrators upon appropriate management authorization.\n•Company operational systems will only hold approved executable code, not development code or compilers.\n•A configuration control system will be used to keep control of all implemented software as well as the system\ndocumentation.\n◦Previous versions of software will be retained as a contingency measure.\n◦Old versions of software will be archived, together with all required information and parameters,\nprocedures, configuration details and supporting software for as long as the data are retained in the\narchive.\n•There will be a rollback strategy in place before changes are implemented.\n•An audit log will be maintained of all updates to operational program libraries.\n\nVersionDateEditorDescription of Changes\n•All decisions to upgrade to a new version release must take into account:\n◦Business requirements for the change\n◦Security of the release, e.g. the introduction of new information security functionality or the number\nand severity of information security problems affecting this version.\n•Change security measures will be in place, to include:\n◦Branch protection rules (Gitlab);\n◦Review & approval from the security team in case of significant changes;\n◦Changes deployed to production only by specifically authorized personnel with escalated privileges;\nand,\n◦Post deployment QA testing to ensure the change is functioning as intended in the production\nenvironment.\nSupplier Services\nManagement of changes to supplier services is covered in theVendor Management Policyin the Policy Center.\nConfiguration Management\nFor configuration management, production and system network changes will only be implemented with properly\nconducted procedures:\n•Terraform and Gitlab are used to standardize and automate configuration management.\n•No systems are deployed into Checkstep environments without approval of the Checkstep CTO or\nEngineering Manager.\n•All changes to production systems, network devices, and firewalls are approved by the Checkstep Checkstep\nCTO or Engineering Manager before they are implemented to assure they comply with business and security\nrequirements.\n•All changes to production systems are tested before they are implemented in production.\n•Implementation of approved changes are only performed by authorized personnel.\n•Tooling to generate an up-to-date inventory of systems, including corresponding architecture diagrams for\nrelated products and services, is hosted on Gitlab in the form of Terraform Code.\n•All frontend functionality (developer dashboards and portals) is separated from backend (database and app\nservers) systems by being deployed on separate servers or containers.\n•All committed code is reviewed using pull requests to assure software code quality and proactively detect\npotential security issues in development.\n•Checkstep utilizes development and staging environments that mirror production to assure proper function.\n•All formal change requests require unique ID and authentication.\n•Identities assigned to multiple persons (e.g. shared identities) are only permitted where they are necessary for\nbusiness or operational reasons and are subject to dedicated approval and documentation.\n•Clocks are continuously synchronized to an authoritative source across all systems using a single reference\ntime source. Modifying time data on systems is restricted.\nRevision History\n\n1.0January 19, 2023Vilius PankauskasInitial Creation\n1.1May 2nd, 2023Vilius PankauskasEdits to match the process of Checkstep\n1.112-Nov-2024Vilius Pankauskasno changes\n\nPolicy version history\nPolicy details\nPolicy name\nChange Management Policy\nRenewal date\nDecember 1, 2025\nDescription\nThis policy establishes the company's processes to manage changes across the organization in a well-communicated, planned and\npredictable manner that minimizes unplanned outages and unforeseen system issues.\nVersion history\nVersion 1\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nJanuary 12, 2023-Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas\nVersion 2\nExplanation of changes\nNew policy with the edits to match the existing Checkstep process\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nMay 2, 2023May 2, 2023Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas\nVersion 3\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 12, 2024November 18, 2024Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"result\": \"Invalid\",\n  \"details\": [\n    {\n      \"control\": \"A.8.27 Secure system architecture and engineering principles\",\n      \"issue\": \"The document Change Management Policy has no things that can cover this control.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}]}

Records of findings must be retained for at least 2 years.\nThe scanning and identification of Checkstep's system vulnerabilities is performed by:\n•Automated Drata security agent installed on all employees' machines.\n•AWS Inspector for infrastructure and AWS ECR vulnerability scanner for images\nAdditionally, periodic security scans of Checkstep systems are done using a combination of external open-source and\ncommercial vulnerability testing tools, including but not limited to:\n•Container Analysis performs vulnerability scans on images in artifact registry\n•Secrets scanning in the code base\n•Dependency scanning automatically finds security vulnerabilities in software dependencies. For example,\nGitLab dependency scanning is interopable with Python package managers using a tool called Gemnasium.\nUser Interface applications using JavaScript can have dependencies scanned using a tool such as Retire.js\nPenetration Testing\nInternal penetration tests are done regularly as the product is being developed by Checkstep security team utilising\nautomated and manual processes. Penetration testing is performed by a certified penetration tester from an independent\nthird party at least once every two years or upon Checkstep's client request, whichever comes sooner.\nFindings from a vulnerability scan and/or penetration test are analyzed by the Security Officer, together with IT and\nEngineering as needed, and reported through the process defined in the next section.\nSecurity Findings Reporting, Tracking and Remediation\nCheckstep follows a simple vulnerability tracking process using Jira. The records of findings are retained for minimal 2\nyears.\nReporting a Finding\n•Upon identification of a vulnerability (including vulnerability in software, system, or process), a Jira ticket is\ncreated.\n•The description of the Finding should include further details, without any confidential information, and a link\nto the source.\n•The Finding will be given a priority level in Jira\nPriority/Severity Ratings and Service Level Agreements\nIn an effort to quickly remediate security vulnerabilities, the following timelines have been put in place to address\n\nPriority\nLevel\nSLADefinitionExamples\nCritical24HVulnerabilities that cause a privilege escalation on\nthe platform from unprivileged to admin, allows\nremote code execution, financial theft, unauthorized\naccess to/extraction of sensitive data, etc.\nVulnerabilities that result in Remote\nCode Execution such as Vertical\nAuthentication bypass, SSRF, XXE,\nSQL Injection, User authentication\nbypass\nHigh5\ndays\nVulnerabilities that affect the security of the platform\nincluding the processes it supports.\nLateral authentication bypass, Stored\nXSS, some CSRF depending on impact\nMediumBest\neffort\nVulnerabilities that affect multiple users, and require\nlittle or no user interaction to trigger\nReflective XSS, Direct object reference,\nURL Redirect, some CSRF depending\non impact\nLowBest\neffort\nIssues that affect singular users and require\ninteraction or significant prerequisites (MitM) to\ntrigger.\nCommon flaws, Debug information,\nMixed Content\nvulnerabilities:\nIn the case a severity rating and/or priority level is updated after a vulnerability finding was originally created, the SLA\nis updated as follow:\n•Priority upgrade: reset SLA from time of escalation\n•Priority downgrade: SLA time remains the same from time of creation/identification of finding\nResolving a Finding\n•The Finding should be assigned to the owner responsible for the system or software package.\n•All findings should be addressed according to the established SLA.\n•No software should be deployed to production with unresolved CRITICAL or HIGH findings, unless an\nException is in place (see below).\n•A finding may be resolved by\n1.providing a valid fix/mitigation\n2.determining as a false positive\n3.documenting an approved exception\nClosing a Finding\n•The assignee should provide a valid resolution (see above) and add a comment to the finding.\n•The finding should be re-assigned to the Reporter or a member of the security team for validation.\n•Upon validation, the finding can be marked as Done (closed) by the Reporter.\n•Before the finding can be marked as closed by the reporter, the fix must be deployed to a development\nenvironment and have a targeted release date for deploying to production noted on the ticket.\nExceptions\n•An Exception may be requested when a viable or direct fix to a vulnerability is not available. For example, a\nversion of the package that contains the fix is not supported on the particular operating system in use.\n•An alternative solution (a.k.a. compensating control) must be in place to address the original vulnerability\nsuch that the risk is mitigated. The compensating control may be technical or a process or a combination of\nboth.\n•An Exception must be opened in the form of a Jira ticket\n\n•The Exception Issue must reference the original Finding by adding an Issue Link to the Finding issue.\n•Each Exception must be reviewed and approved by the Security Officer and the impacted asset owner.\nRevision History\nVersionDateEditorDescription of Changes\nInitial Creation\n1.108-11-2022\nVilius\nPankauskas\nSpecifying the penetration testing schedule\n1.2\n7th Nov\n2023\nVilius\nPankauskas\nadding the secrets scanner as a part of scanners suite\n1.318 Nov 2024\nVilius\nPankauskas\nfixed the frequency of the scans (twice a year) to match the Drata\ncontrols\n\nPolicy version history\nPolicy details\nPolicy name\nVulnerability Management Policy\nRenewal date\nDecember 1, 2025\nDescription\nThe Vulnerability Management Policy outlines the company's procedures to uncover, classify, track, and remediate security\nvulnerabilities.\nVersion history\nVersion 1\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nAugust 28, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 2\nExplanation of changes\nThe penetration testing policy is changed\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nFebruary 1, 2022-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 3\nExplanation of changes\nAdd example tools and move medium vulnerabilities to best effort\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nFebruary 15, 2022February 15, 2022Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\n\nVersion 4\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 8, 2022November 23, 2022Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 5\nExplanation of changes\nyearly policies review\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 30, 2023November 30, 2023Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas\nVersion 6\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 18, 2024November 18, 2024Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"result\": \"Invalid\",\n  \"details\": [\n    {\n      \"control\": \"A.8.27 Secure system architecture and engineering principles\",\n      \"issue\": \"This policy specifically described the management of vulnerability.

Checkstep will manage all system and application changes\nsubject to this policy (e.g. operating system, computing hardware, networks, applications, data centers) in accordance\nwith the applicable change management procedures.\nProcedures\nThe objective of this process is to manage the introduction of any change into production by ensuring that the correct\nprocedures are being followed, proper documentation has been completed, proper testing has been performed, and\nproper approval is in place.\nOrganizational Change Control\nThe following procedures apply to all changes, including infrastructure, code, and networking changes, as well as the\ndeployment of new hardware:\n•A record of agreed authorization levels will be maintained.\n•Changes are only submitted by authorized users.\n•Controls and integrity procedures will be reviewed to ensure that they will not be compromised by the\nchanges.\n•Security critical code to minimize the likelihood of known security weaknesses will be identified and\nchecked.\n•Formal approval must be obtained for detailed proposals before work begins.\n•Changes will be implemented at a time that is least intrusive to business processes involved.\n•Vendor-supplied software will be used without modification; in the event that a modification is necessary, the\nfollowing will be evaluated:\n◦Risk of compromising built-in controls and integrity processes\n◦Vendor consent\n◦Getting the modifications from vendor as standard updates\n◦Impact of owning the responsibility for maintaining the program\n◦Compatibility with other software in use.\n•A technical review of applications will be conducted after changes to operating platforms (operating systems,\ndatabases and middleware platforms). The review will include:\n\n◦Application control and integrity procedures to ensure that they have not been compromised by the\noperating platform changes.\n◦Timely notification of operating platform changes to allow appropriate tests and reviews to take\nplace before implementation.\n◦Appropriate changes are made to the business continuity plans.\n•Customers must be notified of major changes (new subprocessor, etc.) or changes that may lead to system\ndowntime, at least 2 business days prior to their deployment to the production environment.\nPlanned Changes\nFor planned changes, Checkstep will:\n•Plan the implementation and assign tasks, responsibilities, deadlines and resources using the internal changes\ntracking system;\n•For the significant changes that impact the product on a deeper level the Architecture Decision Record (ADR)\nwill be filed in the ADR catalog;\n•Implement changes according to the plan;\n•Monitor the implementation to confirm that they are implemented according to the plan.\nUnplanned Changes\nFor observed unintended changes, Checkstep will:\n•Review consequences of the changes;\n•Evaluate the occurrence or potential for occurrence of any adverse effects;\n•Plan and implement actions to mitigate any adverse effects as necessary;\n•In the case of Emergency Changes (e.g., when a critical vulnerability is discovered and needs to be resolved\nimmediately), an expedited process may be conducted.\nSoftware Development\nFor software development, operating system applications and software changes will only be implemented after\nextensive and successful testing:\n•The tests will cover:\n◦Usability\n◦Security\n◦Effects on other systems\n◦Tests will be conducted on separate systems (test environment), and all corresponding program\nsource libraries will also be updated, as appropriate.\n•The operational software, applications and program libraries of Checkstep will only be updated by trained\nadministrators upon appropriate management authorization.\n•Company operational systems will only hold approved executable code, not development code or compilers.\n•A configuration control system will be used to keep control of all implemented software as well as the system\ndocumentation.\n◦Previous versions of software will be retained as a contingency measure.\n◦Old versions of software will be archived, together with all required information and parameters,\nprocedures, configuration details and supporting software for as long as the data are retained in the\narchive.\n•There will be a rollback strategy in place before changes are implemented.\n•An audit log will be maintained of all updates to operational program libraries.\n\nVersionDateEditorDescription of Changes\n•All decisions to upgrade to a new version release must take into account:\n◦Business requirements for the change\n◦Security of the release, e.g. the introduction of new information security functionality or the number\nand severity of information security problems affecting this version.\n•Change security measures will be in place, to include:\n◦Branch protection rules (Gitlab);\n◦Review & approval from the security team in case of significant changes;\n◦Changes deployed to production only by specifically authorized personnel with escalated privileges;\nand,\n◦Post deployment QA testing to ensure the change is functioning as intended in the production\nenvironment.\nSupplier Services\nManagement of changes to supplier services is covered in theVendor Management Policyin the Policy Center.\nConfiguration Management\nFor configuration management, production and system network changes will only be implemented with properly\nconducted procedures:\n•Terraform and Gitlab are used to standardize and automate configuration management.\n•No systems are deployed into Checkstep environments without approval of the Checkstep CTO or\nEngineering Manager.\n•All changes to production systems, network devices, and firewalls are approved by the Checkstep Checkstep\nCTO or Engineering Manager before they are implemented to assure they comply with business and security\nrequirements.\n•All changes to production systems are tested before they are implemented in production.\n•Implementation of approved changes are only performed by authorized personnel.\n•Tooling to generate an up-to-date inventory of systems, including corresponding architecture diagrams for\nrelated products and services, is hosted on Gitlab in the form of Terraform Code.\n•All frontend functionality (developer dashboards and portals) is separated from backend (database and app\nservers) systems by being deployed on separate servers or containers.\n•All committed code is reviewed using pull requests to assure software code quality and proactively detect\npotential security issues in development.\n•Checkstep utilizes development and staging environments that mirror production to assure proper function.\n•All formal change requests require unique ID and authentication.\n•Identities assigned to multiple persons (e.g. shared identities) are only permitted where they are necessary for\nbusiness or operational reasons and are subject to dedicated approval and documentation.\n•Clocks are continuously synchronized to an authoritative source across all systems using a single reference\ntime source. Modifying time data on systems is restricted.\nRevision History\n\n1.0January 19, 2023Vilius PankauskasInitial Creation\n1.1May 2nd, 2023Vilius PankauskasEdits to match the process of Checkstep\n1.112-Nov-2024Vilius Pankauskasno changes\n\nPolicy version history\nPolicy details\nPolicy name\nChange Management Policy\nRenewal date\nDecember 1, 2025\nDescription\nThis policy establishes the company's processes to manage changes across the organization in a well-communicated, planned and\npredictable manner that minimizes unplanned outages and unforeseen system issues.\nVersion history\nVersion 1\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nJanuary 12, 2023-Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas\nVersion 2\nExplanation of changes\nNew policy with the edits to match the existing Checkstep process\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nMay 2, 2023May 2, 2023Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas\nVersion 3\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 12, 2024November 18, 2024Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"result\": \"Valid\",\n  \"details\": []\n}"}]}

Applicable security requirements and controls\nwill be identified through an information security risk assessment.\nDesign System Component Phase\nThe Design System Components phase transforms requirements into specifications to guide the work of the\nDevelopment phase. The decisions made in this phase address how the system will meet the functional, physical,\ninterface, data, and security requirements. Design phase activities may be conducted in an iterative fashion, producing a\nsystem design that emphasizes the functional features of the system and technical detail.\nBuild System Component Phase\nThe Build phase transforms the detailed system design into complete coded software units and eventually, into an\nintegrated product for release. Each software unit and subsequent integrated units are tested thoroughly, to include tests\nfor security vulnerabilities. System documents that support installation and operations are also developed in this phase.\nEvaluate System Readiness Phase\nThe evaluation phase ensures that the system, as designed and built, satisfies the requirements of the user, as well as\napplicable security requirements. Whenever possible, independent testers measure the system's ability to perform the\nfunctions that are required by the customer and ensure an acceptable level of quality, performance, and security. Once\nthe phase is complete, it will be evident whether or not the system is ready for operation or redevelopment.\nSystem Deployment Phase\nSystem Deployment phase is the final phase of the development life cycle, when the system is released initially to a\npilot site, where any further security vulnerabilities can be identified, and then into the production environment. All\nnecessary training for using the system is accomplished.\nProject Management\nThe sequence of the development phases depends on the software development approach taken. The project\nmanagement approaches include but are not limited to:\n•Waterfall Development\n•Agile Development\n•Iterative Development\n•Staged Delivery Development\nBased on the approach for and the size of the software development, some of the phases can be combined. In Iterative\nDevelopment there may be multiple Cycles (iterations) of the above phases before the final software is released.\nManaging Test Information\nTest data must be carefully managed to ensure it does not compromise the security, privacy, or integrity of production\nenvironments. Under no circumstances should test information, such as test accounts, data, or configurations, be\ndeployed to production environments. If test data or accounts are inadvertently introduced into production, they must\nbe promptly identified and securely removed. Testing activities should always utilize dedicated environments separate\nfrom production, and production-like security controls must be implemented in test environments to safeguard sensitive\ndata. Where the use of production data in testing is unavoidable, it must be approved by the Information Resource\nOwner, anonymized or tokenized wherever feasible, and securely deleted after testing is completed.\n\nSecure System Engineering Principles\nInformation security implications will be addressed and reviewed regularly, and responsibilities for information security\nwill be defined and allocated to the roles defined in the project management methods.\nSDLC Security Control Guidelines\nThe SDLC process will adhere to the following information security controls:\n•Adequate procedures should be established to provide separation of duties in the origination and approval of\nsource documents. This shall include but not be limited to separation of duties between Personnel assigned to\nthe development/test environment and those assigned to the production environment.\n•Modification of code or an emergency release will follow the change control standard.\n•Secure programming standards should be followed. Secure code training should be provided to Checkstep's\ndevelopers.\n•Secure development environment will be created, based on:\n◦sensitivity of data to be processed, stored and transmitted by the system;\n◦applicable external and internal requirements, e.g. from regulations or policies;\n◦security controls already implemented by the organization that support system development;\n◦trustworthiness of personnel working in the environment;\n◦the degree of outsourcing associated with system development;\n◦the need for segregation between different development environments;\n◦control of access to the development environment;\n◦monitoring of change to the environment and code stored therein;\n◦backups are stored at secure offsite locations; and,\n◦control over movement of data from and to the environment.\n•All software deployed on Corporate or Hosted infrastructure must prevent security issues including but not\nlimited to those covered by the best practices SANS and OWASP for the secure development of software.\n•Code changes are reviewed by individuals other than the originating code author and by individuals who are\nknowledgeable in code review techniques and secure coding practices.\n•Overrides of edit checks, approvals, and changes to confirmed transactions should be appropriately\nauthorized, documented, and reviewed.\n•Application development activity should be separated from the production and test environments. The extent\nof separation, logical or physical, is recommended to be appropriate to the risk of the business application or\nbe in line with customer contractual requirements. The level of separation that is necessary between\nproduction, development, and test environments should be evaluated and controls established to secure that\nseparation.\n•All changes to production environments should strictly follow change control procedures, including human\napproval of all changes, granted by an authorized owner of that environment. Automated updates should be\ndisallowed without such approval.\n•Active production environments should not be re-used as test environments. Inactive and/or decommissioned\nproduction environments should not be used as test environments unless all private data has been removed.\nTest environments should not be re-used as production environments without going through a\ndecommissioning and recommissioning process that cleans all remnants of test data, tools, etc.\n•Individuals who are responsible for supporting or writing code for an internet-facing application, or internal\napplication that utilizes web technology and handles customer information, should complete annual security\ntraining specific to secure coding practices. For individuals supporting or writing code for an internet-facing\napplication, training should also include topics specific to internet threats. The individual should complete the\ntraining prior to writing or supporting the code. The training must include OWASP secure development\nprinciples as well as OWASP top 10 vulnerability awareness for the most recent year available.\n•Custom accounts and user IDs and/or passwords should be removed from applications before applications\nbecome active or are released to customers.\n•Production data should not be used in testing or development environments.\n•Security controls that are in place for the production copy in the test system should be production quality (e.g.\nmirroring the production controls over the data).\n\nFor situations demonstrating that testing needs to use production data, the requirements are the following:\n•The Information Resource Owner will provide approval before production data can be used for testing\npurposes.\n•Wherever possible, the production data should be tokenized or anonymized instead of using production data.\n•Testing and parallel runs should use a separate copy of production data and the test location or destination\nshould be acceptable (e.g. loading confidential production data to a laptop for testing is not acceptable).\n•The data should not be extracted, handled, or used by the test process in a manner that subjects the data to\nunauthorized disclosure.\n•The data should be accessed on a need-to-know basis.\n•Normal test activities should not use production data. In cases where test activity requires access to\nproduction data, access to production data should be restricted to only those individuals who have a\ndocumented business need. Only the information with the documented business need should be accessible by\nthose users.\n•Production data used for testing should be securely erased upon completion of testing.\n•Test data and accounts will be removed before being placed into production.\n•Restricted/Protected Information will be encrypted according to the Encryption Standard while at rest or in\ntransit.\n•Error messages must be handled securely and they must not leak sensitive information.\nRevision History\nVersionDateEditorDescription of Changes\n1.17th Nov 2023Vilius PankauskasInitial Creation\n1.118 Nov 2024Vilius Pankauskasno changes\n\nPolicy version history\nPolicy details\nPolicy name\nSoftware Development Life Cycle Policy\nRenewal date\nDecember 1, 2025\nDescription\nThis policy defines the high-level requirements for providing business program managers, business project managers, technical project\nmanagers, and other program and project stakeholders guidance to support the approval, planning, and life cycle development of the\ncompany's software systems.\nVersion history\nVersion 1\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nAugust 28, 2021December 14, 2021Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 2\nExplanation of changes\nThe change management is now in Operations Security Policy\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nFebruary 2, 2022February 10, 2022Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 3\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 28, 2022November 28, 2022Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 4\n\nExplanation of changes\nyearly policies review\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 30, 2023December 1, 2023Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 5\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 18, 2024November 20, 2024Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"result\": \"Valid\",\n  \"details\": []\n}"}]}

This document defines the specific\nalgorithms approved for use, requirements for key management and protection, and requirements for using\ncryptography in cloud environments.\nRoles and Responsibilities\nThe Chief Information Security Officer is responsible for updating, reviewing, and maintaining this policy.\nPolicy\nCryptography Controls\n\nName of System/Type of\nInformation\nCryptographic ToolEncryption/Signature\nAlgorithm\nKey Size\nData Encryption keysOpenSSL, KMSAES-256-GCM256-bit key\nVirtual Private Network (VPN)\nkeys\nOpenSSL and\nOpenVPN\nRSA-40964096-bit key\nWebsite SSL CertificateOpenSSL, CERT,\nACM\nRSA-20482048-bit key\nWebsite SSL keysOpenSSL, KMSRSA-2048and AES-256-GCM\n2048-bit key and 256-bit\nkey\nSSH keysOpenSSL, OpenSSHRSA-20482048-bit key\nCheckstep must protect individual systems or information by means of cryptographic controls as defined in Table 3:\nTable 3: Cryptographic Controls\nObtaining Information\nWhen required, customers of Checkstep's cloud-based software platform offering must be able to obtain information\nregarding:\n•The cryptographic tools used to protect their information.\n•Any capabilities that are available to allow cloud service customers to apply their own cryptographic\nsolutions.\n•The identity of the countries where the cryptographic tools are used to store or transfer cloud service\ncustomers' data.\n\nGoverning Law\nThe use of organizationally-approved encryption must be governed in accordance with the laws of the country, region,\nor other regulating entity in which users perform their work. Encryption must not be used to violate any laws or\nregulations including import/export restrictions. The encryption used by Checkstep conforms to international standards,\nand thus can be used across international boundaries for business purposes.\nKey Management\nExcept where otherwise stated, keys must be managed by their owners. Cryptographic keys must be protected against\nloss, change or destruction by applying appropriate access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized use and backing\nup keys on a regular basis.\nKey Management Service\nAll key management must be performed using software that automatically manages key generation, access control,\nsecure storage, backup and rotation of keys. Specifically:\n•The key management service must provide key access to specifically-designated users, with the ability to\nencrypt/decrypt information and generate data encryption keys.\n•The key management service must provide key administration access to specifically-designated users, with\nthe ability to create, schedule delete, enable/disable rotation, and set usage policies for keys.\n•The key management service must store and backup keys for the entirety of their operational lifetime.\n•The key management service must rotate keys at least once every 12 months.\nSecret Key\nKeys used for secret key encryption (symmetric cryptography), must be protected as they are distributed to all parties\nthat will use them.\n•During distribution, the symmetric encryption keys must be encrypted using a stronger algorithm with a key\nof the longest key length for that algorithm.\n•If the keys are for the strongest algorithm, then the key must be split, each portion of the key encrypted with a\ndifferent key that is the longest key length authorized and the each encrypted portion is transmitted using\ndifferent transmission mechanisms.\nSymmetric encryption keys, when at rest, must be protected with security measures at least as stringent as the measures\nused for distribution of that key.\nPublic Key\nPublic key cryptography (asymmetric cryptography), uses public-private key pairs. The public key is passed to the\ncertificate authority to be included in the digital certificate issued to the end user. The digital certificate is available to\neveryone once it issued. The private key should only be available to the end user to whom the corresponding digital\ncertificate is issued.\nPublic-private key pair may be generated in software on the end user's computer and can be stored as files on the hard\ndrive.\n\n•If the keys are generated in software, the end user is required to create at least one backup of these keys and\nstore any backup copies securely in the password manager.\n•The user is also required to create an escrow copy of any private keys used for encrypting data and deliver the\nescrow copy to the local Information Security representative for secure storage.\n•All backups, including escrow copies, shall be protected with a password or passphrase that is compliant with\nCheckstepPassword Policy.\nPGP Key Pairs\nIf the business partner requires the use of PGP, the public-private key pairs can be stored in the user's keyring/keychain\nfiles on the computer hard drive. PGP will be configured to require entering the passphrase for every use of the private\nkeys in the secret key ring.\nPersonal Identification Numbers (PINs), Passwords and Passphrases\nAll PINs, passwords or passphrases used to protect encryption keys must meet complexity and length requirements\ndescribed in Checkstep'sPassword Policy.\nLoss and Theft\nThe loss, theft, or potential unauthorized disclosure of any encryption key covered by this policy must be reported\nimmediately.\nRevision History\nVersionDateEditorDescription of Changes\n1.010-09-2021Tuan LeInitial Creation\n1.127 Oct 2023Vilius Pankauskasno changes\n1.121 Nov 2024Vilius Pankauskasno changes\n\nPolicy version history\nPolicy details\nPolicy name\nEncryption Policy\nRenewal date\nDecember 1, 2025\nDescription\nThe Encryption Policy is to establish: the types of data, devices and media that need to be encrypted, when encryption must be used,\nand the minimum standards of the software and techniques used for encryption.\nVersion history\nVersion 1\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nDecember 8, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 2\nExplanation of changes\nThe encryption control table is updated\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nDecember 9, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 3\nExplanation of changes\nSome parts are removed\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nDecember 10, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\n\nVersion 4\nExplanation of changes\nHardware token section is removed\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nDecember 15, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 5\nExplanation of changes\nAdd roles and responsibilities\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nFebruary 15, 2022February 15, 2022Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 6\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 28, 2022November 28, 2022Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 7\nExplanation of changes\nyearly policies review\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 30, 2023December 1, 2023Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 8\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 21, 2024November 21, 2024Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"result\": \"Valid\",\n  \"details\": []\n}"}]}

Security controls, including authentication, authorization, data\nencryption, and auditing, should be applied according to the highest classification of data in a given\nrepository.\n•Employees shall not have direct administrative access to production data during normal business operations.\nExceptions include emergency operations such as forensic analysis and manual disaster recovery.\n•All Production Systems must disable services that are not required to achieve the business purpose or function\nof the system.\n•All access to Production Systems must be logged.\n•All Production Systems must have security monitoring enabled, including activity and file integrity\nmonitoring, vulnerability scanning, and/or malware detection, as applicable.\nData Protection Implementation and Processes\nCustomerData Protection\nAll Checkstep employees adhere to the following processes to reduce the risk of compromising Production Data:\n•Implement and/or review controls designed to protect Production Data from improper alteration or\ndestruction.\n•Ensure that confidential data is stored in a manner that supports user access logs and automated monitoring\nfor potential security incidents.\n•Ensure Checkstep Customer Production Data is segmented and only accessible to Customer authorized to\naccess data.\n•All Production Data at rest is stored on encrypted volumes using encryption keys managed by Checkstep.\n•Volume encryption keys and machines that generate volume encryption keys are protected from unauthorized\naccess. Volume encryption key material is protected with access controls such that the key material is only\naccessible by privileged accounts.\nAccess\nCheckstep employee access to production is guarded by an approval process and by default is disabled. When access is\napproved, temporary access is granted that allows access to production. Production access is reviewed by the security\nteam on a case by case basis.\nSeparation\nCustomer data is logically separated at the database/datastore level using a unique identifier for the customer. The\nseparation is enforced at the API layer where the client must authenticate with a chosen account and then the customer\nunique identifier is included in the access token and used by the API to restrict access to data to the account. All\ndatabase/datastore queries then include the account identifier.\nMonitoring\nCheckstep uses AWS CloudWatch to monitor the entire cloud service operation. If a system failure and alarm is\ntriggered, key personnel are notified by text, chat, and/or email message in order to take appropriate corrective action.\nCheckstep uses a security agent to monitor production systems. The agents monitor system activities, generate alerts on\nsuspicious activities and report on vulnerability findings to a centralized management console.\nData At Rest\nEncryption\n\nAll databases, data stores, and file systems are encrypted according to Checkstep'sEncryption Policy.\nRetention\nStored data must be properly categorized and a retention schedule applied accordingly in conjunction with Checkstep's\nAsset Management Policy,Data Classification PolicyandData Deletion Policy. Considerations for retention\ntimeframe include:\n•Statutory, regulatory or contractual requirements\n•Type of data (e.g., accounting records, database records, audit logs)\n•Type of storage media (e.g., paper, hard drive, server)\nStorage and Disposal\nStored data must be properly stored and handled while at rest. Considerations for storage and disposal of data at rest in\nconjunction with Checkstep'sAsset Management Policy,Data Classification PolicyandData Deletion Policyinclude:\n•Authorization to access or manage stored data\n•Proper identification of records and their retention period\n•Technology change and ability to access data throughout retention period\n•Acceptable timeframe and format to retrieve data\n•Appropriate methods of disposal\nData In Transit\nNecessity\nData will only be transferred where strictly necessary for effective business processes.\nTransfer Factors\nBefore choosing the method of data transfer, the following must be considered:\n•Nature, sensitivity, confidentiality, and value of the information\n•Size of data being transferred\n•Impact of loss during transit\nEncryption\nTo ensure the safety of data in transit:\n•All external data transmission must be encrypted end-to-end using encryption keys managed by Checkstep.\nThis includes, but is not limited to, cloud infrastructure and third party vendors and applications.\n•All internet and intranet connections are encrypted and authenticated using a strong protocol, a strong key\nexchange, and a strong cipher.\nEnd-user Messaging Channels\n•Restricted and sensitive data is not allowed to be sent over electronic end-user messaging channels such as\nemail or chat, unless end-to-end encryption is enabled.\n•Messages must be protected from unauthorized access, modification or denial of service commensurate with\n\nthe classification scheme adopted by the organization.\n•Messages must be reviewed prior to sending to ensure correct addressing and transportation of the message.\n•The reliability and availability of the messaging channel must be verified.\n•All applicable legal requirements will be adhered to.\n•Use of external public services such as instant messaging, social networking or file sharing will require prior\napproval and authorization.\n•Publicly accessible networks will be controlled by stronger authentication.\nRevision History\nVersionDateEditorDescription of Changes\n1.008-09-2021Tuan LeInitial Creation\n1.1.27 Oct 2023Vilius Pankauskasno changes\n1.121 Nov 2024Vilius Pankauskasno changes\n\nPolicy version history\nPolicy details\nPolicy name\nData Protection Policy\nRenewal date\nDecember 1, 2025\nDescription\nThe Data Protection policy outlines many of the procedures and technical controls in support of data protection.\nVersion history\nVersion 1\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nSeptember 8, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 2\nExplanation of changes\nsome policies are added\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nDecember 8, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 3\nExplanation of changes\nEvent Logs is moved to Operations Security Policy\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nDecember 15, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\n\nVersion 4\nExplanation of changes\n\"Checkstep hosts on AWS in the EU-West-1 (Ireland) region by default.

The following procedures\nwill be enforced as applicable to Checkstep assets to ensure proper maintenance, tracking, monitoring, and handling of\nassets:\n•A detailed asset inventory will be maintained to track and monitor assets.\n◦All significant assets will be accounted for on the inventory.\n◦Items can be excluded from the inventory if they carry very low purchase/replacement costs\n(including time and labor needed to install and configure) and pose little or no risk to business\noperations or compliance status.\n•Each significant asset serial number will be associated with an employee possessing it. The assets to names\nlist will be stored in an online inventory list.\n◦Details should include a description of the type of asset, the make/model of the asset, technical\nspecifications, license details, and versions of the software packages or operating systems.\n◦Assets that contain, store, or handle information, will be classified per theData Classification\n\nPolicy.\n•All copies of media assets will be clearly marked for the attention of the authorized recipient.\n◦Temporary or permanent copies of information will be at a level consistent with the protection of the\noriginal information.\n•Access to each asset will be restricted based on the asset's classification.\n•A record of authorized recipients of assets will be established and maintained.\n•The disposal/replacement of physical and virtual assets will be tracked, whether it is due to depreciation,\nexpiring leases or agreements, obsolescence/end of support, loss, or other reasons.\n•A reporting function will support auditing and monitoring for IT compliance with this standard.\nAsset Inventory Standard\nAn asset inventory process must be in place to support the technological management of critical business processes and\nto meet legal and regulatory requirements. The inventory process will also support the discovery, management and\nreplacement/ disposal of all assets. It will further facilitate the identification and removal of any illegal or unauthorized\nsoftware, asset, or processes found in the Checkstep environment. To accomplish these goals, all physical and virtual\nassets under Checkstep management or control will be listed in an inventory that will include:\n•Unique identifier or name of the asset.\n•Description of the asset\n•Purpose of the asset and the role the asset has in supporting critical business processes and in meeting legal or\nregulatory requirements., if applicable\n•Entity responsible for the asset\n•Classification of the asset, if applicable, as prescribed in theData Classification Policy\nAsset Ownership\nCheckstep will assign an owner to each asset when the asset is created or transferred to Checkstep. The asset owner can\nbe an individual or an entity with approved management responsibility to control the whole lifecycle of the asset; the\nasset owner will not necessarily have property rights to the asset.\nThe asset owner will be responsible for the proper management of the asset over the asset's entire lifecycle, or until a\nnew owner is assigned to the asset. The asset owner will:\n•Ensure that assets are inventoried.\n•Ensure that assets are appropriately classified and protected.\n•Define and periodically review access restrictions and classification to important assets, taking into account\napplicable access control policies.\n•Ensure proper handling when the asset is deleted/destroyed.\nPhysical Asset Inventory\nCheckstep leverages a SaaS-based asset management system, Drata, to maintain inventory of all company owned\nphysical computing equipment, including but not limited to:\n\n•Servers\n•Workstations\n•Laptops\n•Printers\n•Networking equipment\nAll company-owned devices are subject to a complete data wipe if deemed necessary, such as in the case of device\ninfection or repurpose. This data wipe will be carried out by the employee to whom the device is assigned with the\nsupervision of the IT manager.\nDigital Asset Inventory\nCheckstep uses Drata's automated system to query across our cloud-based infrastructure to obtain detailed records of\nall digital assets, including but not limited to:\n•Virtual machines\n•Virtual servers\n•Virtual repositories\n•Security agents\n•Source code repositories\n•User accounts\nThe records are stored in a database system maintained by Checkstep. Records are tagged with owner/project and\nclassification when applicable. All records are kept up to date through automation via Drata.\nAsset Retirement Standard\nThe information resource owner determines when an asset no longer is needed or is obsolete and can be retired. If the\nasset to be replaced/retired supports mandatory legal and regulatory requirements of critical business processes, the\ninformation resource owner must ensure that any replacement asset can support these processes before the current asset\nis retired.\nBefore retiring/replacing any asset that retains data, data retention requirements for all data stored or managed by that\nasset must be reviewed, and a plan for complying with all applicable data retention requirements must be developed\nand executed. This is particularly important for assets that manage data subject to legal/regulatory scrutiny. Any data\nsubject to data retention requirements must be migrated to an appropriate destination and tested for appropriateness,\ncompleteness, accessibility and retrievability from the destination before the original data is deleted from the original\nasset as part of the asset retirement process.\nManagement of Media\nReturn of Assets Upon Termination\n•The termination process includes the return of all previously issued physical and electronic assets owned by\nor entrusted to Checkstep, as outlined in theEmployment Terms and Conditions, andAsset Management\nPolicy.\n•If Checkstep equipment was purchased by an employee or third party user, or personal equipment was used,\n\nall relevant information must be transferred to Checkstep and securely erased from the equipment.\n•Unauthorized copying of information by employees and contractors will be monitored and controlled during\nthe termination period.\nDisposal of Media\nThe steps for the secure disposal of media containing confidential information will be proportional to the sensitivity of\nthat information. The following guidelines will be applied accordingly:\n•Identification of items that require disposal.\n•Use of appropriate third party collection and disposal services in accordance with theVendor Management\nPolicy.\n•Secure disposal by incineration or shredding, or erasure of data for use by another application within the\ncompany.\n•Risk assessment of damaged media to determine disposal or repair.\n•Whole-disk encryption to mitigate risk of disclosure of confidential information, in line with Checkstep\nEncryption Policy.\n•Logging each disposal to maintain an audit trail.\nIntellectual Property Rights\nCheckstep takes handling and safeguarding of intellectual property very seriously. Intellectual property rights include\nsoftware or document copyright, design rights, trademarks, patents and source code licenses.\nTo ensure this the following procedures will be maintained:\n•Software will only be acquired through known and reputable sources, to ensure that copyright is not violated.\n•An asset inventory will identify all assets with requirements to protect intellectual property rights.\n•Proof and evidence of ownership of licenses, master disks, manuals, etc. will be maintained.\n•Review of the asset inventory will also make sure that only software and licensed products are installed.\n•Will ensure compliance with terms and conditions for software and information obtained from public\nnetworks\nWorkload\nSoftwareVersionLicenseResponsible\nContent ModerationAPI Service (Python)CheckstepCheckstep\nDatabasePostgresql - AWS RDSAWS\nMemcacheRedis - AWS ElasticaheAWS\nMessagingKafka - AWS MSKAWS\nIndexingElasticsearch - AWS ESAWS\n\nRevision History\nVersionDateEditorDescription of Changes\n1.025 Aug 2021Guillaume BouchardInitial Creation\n1.114 Dec 2021SagharSimplification of the policy (no more removable media)\n1.208 Nov 2022Vilius PankauskasChanged parts about inventory list and data wipe\n1.226 Oct 2023Vilius Pankauskasno changes\n1.212-Nov-2024Vilius Pankauskasno changes\n\nPolicy version history\nPolicy details\nPolicy name\nAsset Management Policy\nRenewal date\nDecember 1, 2025\nDescription\nThe Asset Management Policy defines the implementation and documentation of asset management practices, plans, processes &\nprocedures within the organization\nVersion history\nVersion 1\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nDecember 14, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 2\nExplanation of changes\nSystem Hardening Standards and Capacity Management are moved to Operations Security\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nDecember 15, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 3\nExplanation of changes\nIP rights is added\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nJanuary 5, 2022February 10, 2022Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\n\nVersion 4\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 8, 2022November 23, 2022Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 5\nExplanation of changes\nyearly policies review\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 30, 2023December 1, 2023Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 6\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 12, 2024November 20, 2024Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"result\": \"Valid\",\n  \"details\": []\n}"}]}

Security controls, including authentication, authorization, data\nencryption, and auditing, should be applied according to the highest classification of data in a given\nrepository.\n•Employees shall not have direct administrative access to production data during normal business operations.\nExceptions include emergency operations such as forensic analysis and manual disaster recovery.\n•All Production Systems must disable services that are not required to achieve the business purpose or function\nof the system.\n•All access to Production Systems must be logged.\n•All Production Systems must have security monitoring enabled, including activity and file integrity\nmonitoring, vulnerability scanning, and/or malware detection, as applicable.\nData Protection Implementation and Processes\nCustomerData Protection\nAll Checkstep employees adhere to the following processes to reduce the risk of compromising Production Data:\n•Implement and/or review controls designed to protect Production Data from improper alteration or\ndestruction.\n•Ensure that confidential data is stored in a manner that supports user access logs and automated monitoring\nfor potential security incidents.\n•Ensure Checkstep Customer Production Data is segmented and only accessible to Customer authorized to\naccess data.\n•All Production Data at rest is stored on encrypted volumes using encryption keys managed by Checkstep.\n•Volume encryption keys and machines that generate volume encryption keys are protected from unauthorized\naccess. Volume encryption key material is protected with access controls such that the key material is only\naccessible by privileged accounts.\nAccess\nCheckstep employee access to production is guarded by an approval process and by default is disabled. When access is\napproved, temporary access is granted that allows access to production. Production access is reviewed by the security\nteam on a case by case basis.\nSeparation\nCustomer data is logically separated at the database/datastore level using a unique identifier for the customer. The\nseparation is enforced at the API layer where the client must authenticate with a chosen account and then the customer\nunique identifier is included in the access token and used by the API to restrict access to data to the account. All\ndatabase/datastore queries then include the account identifier.\nMonitoring\nCheckstep uses AWS CloudWatch to monitor the entire cloud service operation. If a system failure and alarm is\ntriggered, key personnel are notified by text, chat, and/or email message in order to take appropriate corrective action.\nCheckstep uses a security agent to monitor production systems. The agents monitor system activities, generate alerts on\nsuspicious activities and report on vulnerability findings to a centralized management console.\nData At Rest\nEncryption\n\nAll databases, data stores, and file systems are encrypted according to Checkstep'sEncryption Policy.\nRetention\nStored data must be properly categorized and a retention schedule applied accordingly in conjunction with Checkstep's\nAsset Management Policy,Data Classification PolicyandData Deletion Policy. Considerations for retention\ntimeframe include:\n•Statutory, regulatory or contractual requirements\n•Type of data (e.g., accounting records, database records, audit logs)\n•Type of storage media (e.g., paper, hard drive, server)\nStorage and Disposal\nStored data must be properly stored and handled while at rest. Considerations for storage and disposal of data at rest in\nconjunction with Checkstep'sAsset Management Policy,Data Classification PolicyandData Deletion Policyinclude:\n•Authorization to access or manage stored data\n•Proper identification of records and their retention period\n•Technology change and ability to access data throughout retention period\n•Acceptable timeframe and format to retrieve data\n•Appropriate methods of disposal\nData In Transit\nNecessity\nData will only be transferred where strictly necessary for effective business processes.\nTransfer Factors\nBefore choosing the method of data transfer, the following must be considered:\n•Nature, sensitivity, confidentiality, and value of the information\n•Size of data being transferred\n•Impact of loss during transit\nEncryption\nTo ensure the safety of data in transit:\n•All external data transmission must be encrypted end-to-end using encryption keys managed by Checkstep.\nThis includes, but is not limited to, cloud infrastructure and third party vendors and applications.\n•All internet and intranet connections are encrypted and authenticated using a strong protocol, a strong key\nexchange, and a strong cipher.\nEnd-user Messaging Channels\n•Restricted and sensitive data is not allowed to be sent over electronic end-user messaging channels such as\nemail or chat, unless end-to-end encryption is enabled.\n•Messages must be protected from unauthorized access, modification or denial of service commensurate with\n\nthe classification scheme adopted by the organization.\n•Messages must be reviewed prior to sending to ensure correct addressing and transportation of the message.\n•The reliability and availability of the messaging channel must be verified.\n•All applicable legal requirements will be adhered to.\n•Use of external public services such as instant messaging, social networking or file sharing will require prior\napproval and authorization.\n•Publicly accessible networks will be controlled by stronger authentication.\nRevision History\nVersionDateEditorDescription of Changes\n1.008-09-2021Tuan LeInitial Creation\n1.1.27 Oct 2023Vilius Pankauskasno changes\n1.121 Nov 2024Vilius Pankauskasno changes\n\nPolicy version history\nPolicy details\nPolicy name\nData Protection Policy\nRenewal date\nDecember 1, 2025\nDescription\nThe Data Protection policy outlines many of the procedures and technical controls in support of data protection.\nVersion history\nVersion 1\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nSeptember 8, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 2\nExplanation of changes\nsome policies are added\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nDecember 8, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 3\nExplanation of changes\nEvent Logs is moved to Operations Security Policy\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nDecember 15, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\n\nVersion 4\nExplanation of changes\n\"Checkstep hosts on AWS in the EU-West-1 (Ireland) region by default.

Access by any other entity is allowable only on a minimum\nnecessary basis. All users are responsible for reporting an incident of unauthorized use or access of the organization's\ninformation systems.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this procedure is to provide a policy and guideline for creating, modifying, or removing access to the\ncompany's network and data by creating, changing or deleting the network account configuration for a User.\nRoles and responsibilities\nThe Chief Information Security Officer is responsible for updating, reviewing, and maintaining this policy.\nScope\nThis policy and defined process is used to allow access to the company's data and systems to individuals who meet the\nrequirements defined in this policy. This policy governs individuals who are granted access that is necessary to support\nthe business. This policy relates to all data used, processed, stored, maintained, or transmitted in and through the\ncompany's systems.\nAccess Establishment and Modification\nRequests for access to Checkstep Platform systems and applications are made formally using the following process:\n\n1.A Checkstep workforce member initiates the access request by creating an Issue in the Checkstep ticketing\nsystem.\na.User identities must be verified prior to granting access to new accounts.\nb.Identity verification must be done in person where possible; for remote employees, identities must\nbe verified over the phone or through a video call.\nc.For new accounts, the method used to verify the user's identity must be recorded on the Issue.\n2.The Security Officer will grant or reject access to systems as dictated by the employee's job title. If additional\naccess is required outside of the minimum necessary to perform job functions, the requester must include a\ndescription of why the additional access is required as part of the access request.\n3.If the request is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.\n4.If the review is approved, the request is marked as \"Done\", and any pertinent notes are added.\nAccess Reviews\nAll access to Checkstep systems and services is reviewed and updated on an annual basis to ensure proper\nauthorizations are in place commensurate with job functions. The process for conducting reviews is outlined below:\n1.The Security Officer initiates the review of user access by creating an Issue in the Checkstep Ticketing\nSystem\n2.The Security Officer is assigned to review levels of access for each Checkstep workforce member.\n3.If user access is found during review that is not in line with the least privilege principle, the Security Officer\nmay modify user access and notify the user of access changes.\n4.Once the review is complete, the Security Officer then marks the ticket as \"Done\", adding any pertinent notes\nrequired.\nWorkforce Clearance\n•The level of security assigned to a user to the organization's information systems is based on the minimum\nnecessary amount of data access required to carry out legitimate job responsibilities assigned to a user's job\nclassification.\n•All access requests are treated on a\"least-access and need-to-know principles.\"\n•Checkstep maintains a minimum necessary approach to access to Customer data.\nUnique User Identification\n•Access to the Checkstep Platform systems and applications is controlled by requiring unique User Login IDs\nand passwords for each individual user and developer.\n•Passwords requirements mandate strong password controls.\n•Passwords are not displayed at any time and are not transmitted or stored in plain text.\n•Default accounts on all production systems, including root, are disabled.\n•Shared accounts are not allowed within Checkstep systems or networks.\n•Automated log-on configurations other than the company's approved Password Management provider that\nstore user passwords or bypass password entry are not permitted for use with Checkstep workstations or\nproduction systems.\nAutomatic Logoff\n•Users are required to make information systems inaccessible by any other individual when unattended by the\nusers (ex. by using a password protected screen saver or logging off the system).\n\nAccess Removal\n•All user IDs that have been inactive for thirty (30) days will be revoked unless specifically authorized by the\ncompany leadership.\n•In response to feedback from management, systems administrators must promptly revoke all privileges no\nlonger needed by users.\nEmployee Devices Usage\nDevices include workstations and mobile devices items such as laptops, notebooks, tablet devices, smartphones and\nsmart watches.\nThe workstations/laptops or other mobile device that at Checkstep are either company owned, or owned by the\nemployee following the BYOD requirement below. An organization-provided device must be used primarily for\nCheckstep-related business purposes and shall be protected.\n•Mobile endpoint devices must meet the requirements for use as stated in theAcceptable Use PolicyandAsset\nManagement Policy.\n•Classified information:The storage, transmission and processing of Checkstep classified information should\nbe primarily done on mobile devices provided by the organization. If not possible, personal device can be\nused if specifically authorized by Checkstep security services,and the BYOD Requirements below have been\nfulfilled.\n•Physical integrity:precautions to protect all mobile devices and computer media must be taken.

Access by any other entity is allowable only on a minimum\nnecessary basis. All users are responsible for reporting an incident of unauthorized use or access of the organization's\ninformation systems.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this procedure is to provide a policy and guideline for creating, modifying, or removing access to the\ncompany's network and data by creating, changing or deleting the network account configuration for a User.\nRoles and responsibilities\nThe Chief Information Security Officer is responsible for updating, reviewing, and maintaining this policy.\nScope\nThis policy and defined process is used to allow access to the company's data and systems to individuals who meet the\nrequirements defined in this policy. This policy governs individuals who are granted access that is necessary to support\nthe business. This policy relates to all data used, processed, stored, maintained, or transmitted in and through the\ncompany's systems.\nAccess Establishment and Modification\nRequests for access to Checkstep Platform systems and applications are made formally using the following process:\n\n1.A Checkstep workforce member initiates the access request by creating an Issue in the Checkstep ticketing\nsystem.\na.User identities must be verified prior to granting access to new accounts.\nb.Identity verification must be done in person where possible; for remote employees, identities must\nbe verified over the phone or through a video call.\nc.For new accounts, the method used to verify the user's identity must be recorded on the Issue.\n2.The Security Officer will grant or reject access to systems as dictated by the employee's job title. If additional\naccess is required outside of the minimum necessary to perform job functions, the requester must include a\ndescription of why the additional access is required as part of the access request.\n3.If the request is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.\n4.If the review is approved, the request is marked as \"Done\", and any pertinent notes are added.\nAccess Reviews\nAll access to Checkstep systems and services is reviewed and updated on an annual basis to ensure proper\nauthorizations are in place commensurate with job functions. The process for conducting reviews is outlined below:\n1.The Security Officer initiates the review of user access by creating an Issue in the Checkstep Ticketing\nSystem\n2.The Security Officer is assigned to review levels of access for each Checkstep workforce member.\n3.If user access is found during review that is not in line with the least privilege principle, the Security Officer\nmay modify user access and notify the user of access changes.\n4.Once the review is complete, the Security Officer then marks the ticket as \"Done\", adding any pertinent notes\nrequired.\nWorkforce Clearance\n•The level of security assigned to a user to the organization's information systems is based on the minimum\nnecessary amount of data access required to carry out legitimate job responsibilities assigned to a user's job\nclassification.\n•All access requests are treated on a\"least-access and need-to-know principles.\"\n•Checkstep maintains a minimum necessary approach to access to Customer data.\nUnique User Identification\n•Access to the Checkstep Platform systems and applications is controlled by requiring unique User Login IDs\nand passwords for each individual user and developer.\n•Passwords requirements mandate strong password controls.\n•Passwords are not displayed at any time and are not transmitted or stored in plain text.\n•Default accounts on all production systems, including root, are disabled.\n•Shared accounts are not allowed within Checkstep systems or networks.\n•Automated log-on configurations other than the company's approved Password Management provider that\nstore user passwords or bypass password entry are not permitted for use with Checkstep workstations or\nproduction systems.\nAutomatic Logoff\n•Users are required to make information systems inaccessible by any other individual when unattended by the\nusers (ex. by using a password protected screen saver or logging off the system).\n\nAccess Removal\n•All user IDs that have been inactive for thirty (30) days will be revoked unless specifically authorized by the\ncompany leadership.\n•In response to feedback from management, systems administrators must promptly revoke all privileges no\nlonger needed by users.\nEmployee Devices Usage\nDevices include workstations and mobile devices items such as laptops, notebooks, tablet devices, smartphones and\nsmart watches.\nThe workstations/laptops or other mobile device that at Checkstep are either company owned, or owned by the\nemployee following the BYOD requirement below. An organization-provided device must be used primarily for\nCheckstep-related business purposes and shall be protected.\n•Mobile endpoint devices must meet the requirements for use as stated in theAcceptable Use PolicyandAsset\nManagement Policy.\n•Classified information:The storage, transmission and processing of Checkstep classified information should\nbe primarily done on mobile devices provided by the organization. If not possible, personal device can be\nused if specifically authorized by Checkstep security services,and the BYOD Requirements below have been\nfulfilled.\n•Physical integrity:precautions to protect all mobile devices and computer media must be taken. For example,\nusers should not leave a laptop unattended or on display in a car such that it would encourage an opportunist\ntheft.\n•No peripheral:Checkstep does not provide to its employees any storage media or peripherals. Ask approval\nfrom Checkstep IT services or Security Officer if adding or using personal peripheral hardware to store and\ntransport business related information is required.\n•Encryption: The device will be secured so that all of the data on it is encrypted and so is only accessible if the\npassword is known.

Records of findings must be retained for at least 2 years.\nThe scanning and identification of Checkstep's system vulnerabilities is performed by:\n•Automated Drata security agent installed on all employees' machines.\n•AWS Inspector for infrastructure and AWS ECR vulnerability scanner for images\nAdditionally, periodic security scans of Checkstep systems are done using a combination of external open-source and\ncommercial vulnerability testing tools, including but not limited to:\n•Container Analysis performs vulnerability scans on images in artifact registry\n•Secrets scanning in the code base\n•Dependency scanning automatically finds security vulnerabilities in software dependencies. For example,\nGitLab dependency scanning is interopable with Python package managers using a tool called Gemnasium.\nUser Interface applications using JavaScript can have dependencies scanned using a tool such as Retire.js\nPenetration Testing\nInternal penetration tests are done regularly as the product is being developed by Checkstep security team utilising\nautomated and manual processes. Penetration testing is performed by a certified penetration tester from an independent\nthird party at least once every two years or upon Checkstep's client request, whichever comes sooner.\nFindings from a vulnerability scan and/or penetration test are analyzed by the Security Officer, together with IT and\nEngineering as needed, and reported through the process defined in the next section.\nSecurity Findings Reporting, Tracking and Remediation\nCheckstep follows a simple vulnerability tracking process using Jira. The records of findings are retained for minimal 2\nyears.\nReporting a Finding\n•Upon identification of a vulnerability (including vulnerability in software, system, or process), a Jira ticket is\ncreated.\n•The description of the Finding should include further details, without any confidential information, and a link\nto the source.\n•The Finding will be given a priority level in Jira\nPriority/Severity Ratings and Service Level Agreements\nIn an effort to quickly remediate security vulnerabilities, the following timelines have been put in place to address\n\nPriority\nLevel\nSLADefinitionExamples\nCritical24HVulnerabilities that cause a privilege escalation on\nthe platform from unprivileged to admin, allows\nremote code execution, financial theft, unauthorized\naccess to/extraction of sensitive data, etc.\nVulnerabilities that result in Remote\nCode Execution such as Vertical\nAuthentication bypass, SSRF, XXE,\nSQL Injection, User authentication\nbypass\nHigh5\ndays\nVulnerabilities that affect the security of the platform\nincluding the processes it supports.\nLateral authentication bypass, Stored\nXSS, some CSRF depending on impact\nMediumBest\neffort\nVulnerabilities that affect multiple users, and require\nlittle or no user interaction to trigger\nReflective XSS, Direct object reference,\nURL Redirect, some CSRF depending\non impact\nLowBest\neffort\nIssues that affect singular users and require\ninteraction or significant prerequisites (MitM) to\ntrigger.\nCommon flaws, Debug information,\nMixed Content\nvulnerabilities:\nIn the case a severity rating and/or priority level is updated after a vulnerability finding was originally created, the SLA\nis updated as follow:\n•Priority upgrade: reset SLA from time of escalation\n•Priority downgrade: SLA time remains the same from time of creation/identification of finding\nResolving a Finding\n•The Finding should be assigned to the owner responsible for the system or software package.\n•All findings should be addressed according to the established SLA.\n•No software should be deployed to production with unresolved CRITICAL or HIGH findings, unless an\nException is in place (see below).\n•A finding may be resolved by\n1.providing a valid fix/mitigation\n2.determining as a false positive\n3.documenting an approved exception\nClosing a Finding\n•The assignee should provide a valid resolution (see above) and add a comment to the finding.\n•The finding should be re-assigned to the Reporter or a member of the security team for validation.\n•Upon validation, the finding can be marked as Done (closed) by the Reporter.\n•Before the finding can be marked as closed by the reporter, the fix must be deployed to a development\nenvironment and have a targeted release date for deploying to production noted on the ticket.\nExceptions\n•An Exception may be requested when a viable or direct fix to a vulnerability is not available. For example, a\nversion of the package that contains the fix is not supported on the particular operating system in use.\n•An alternative solution (a.k.a. compensating control) must be in place to address the original vulnerability\nsuch that the risk is mitigated. The compensating control may be technical or a process or a combination of\nboth.\n•An Exception must be opened in the form of a Jira ticket\n\n•The Exception Issue must reference the original Finding by adding an Issue Link to the Finding issue.\n•Each Exception must be reviewed and approved by the Security Officer and the impacted asset owner.\nRevision History\nVersionDateEditorDescription of Changes\nInitial Creation\n1.108-11-2022\nVilius\nPankauskas\nSpecifying the penetration testing schedule\n1.2\n7th Nov\n2023\nVilius\nPankauskas\nadding the secrets scanner as a part of scanners suite\n1.318 Nov 2024\nVilius\nPankauskas\nfixed the frequency of the scans (twice a year) to match the Drata\ncontrols\n\nPolicy version history\nPolicy details\nPolicy name\nVulnerability Management Policy\nRenewal date\nDecember 1, 2025\nDescription\nThe Vulnerability Management Policy outlines the company's procedures to uncover, classify, track, and remediate security\nvulnerabilities.\nVersion history\nVersion 1\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nAugust 28, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 2\nExplanation of changes\nThe penetration testing policy is changed\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nFebruary 1, 2022-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 3\nExplanation of changes\nAdd example tools and move medium vulnerabilities to best effort\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nFebruary 15, 2022February 15, 2022Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\n\nVersion 4\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 8, 2022November 23, 2022Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 5\nExplanation of changes\nyearly policies review\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 30, 2023November 30, 2023Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas\nVersion 6\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 18, 2024November 18, 2024Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"result\": \"Valid\",\n  \"details\": []\n}"}]}

The strategy describes the\norganization's Recovery Time Objective (RTO), which is defined as the duration of time and service level for critical\nbusiness processes to be restored after a disaster or other disruptive event, as well as the procedures, responsibility and\ntechnical guidance required to meet the RTO. This policy also lists the contact information for personnel and service\nproviders that may be needed during a disaster recovery event.\nThe following conditions must be met for this plan to be viable:\n•All equipment, software and data (or their backups/failovers) are available in some manner.\n•The Information Security Officer is responsible for coordinating and conducting a annual rehearsal of this\ncontinuity plan.\nThis plan does not cover the following types of incidents:\n•Incidents that affect customers or partners but have no effect on the organization's systems; in this case, the\ncustomer must employ their own continuity processes to make sure that they can continue to interact with the\norganization and its systems.\n•Incidents that affect cloud infrastructure suppliers at the core infrastructure level, i.e. Amazon Web Services.\nThe organization depends on such suppliers to employ their own continuity processes.\nThis DRP is maintained and reviewed by the Chief Information Security Officer.\nPurpose\nThe following objectives have been established for this plan:\n1.Maximize the effectiveness of contingency operations through an established plan.\n2.Identify the activities, resources, and procedures needed to carry out Checkstep processing requirements\nduring prolonged interruptions to normal operations.\n3.Identify and define the impact of interruptions to Checkstep systems.\n4.Assign responsibilities to designated personnel and provide guidance for recovering Checkstep systems\nduring prolonged periods of interruption to normal operations.\n5.Ensure coordination with other Checkstep staff who will participate in the Disaster Recovery Planning\nstrategies.\n6.Ensure coordination with external points of contact and vendors who will participate in the Disaster Recovery\nPlanning strategies.\n\nRoles, responsibilities and authorities\nIT recovery team\nThe IT Recovery Team consists of the following people:\nThe IT Recovery Team (IRT) is responsible for:\n•Recovering servers, operating systems, networks and any other components upon which the applications are\nbased\n•Restoration of applications and data from backups and the restoration of LAN and WAN links, including\nliaison with external network suppliers.\n•Setup and configuration of the business applications once they have been restored to the cloud environment.\nThis will involve liaison with third-party application support services.\nBusiness recovery team\nThe members of the Business Recovery Team will depend upon the areas affected and may include:\nThe Business Recovery Team is responsible for:\n•Managing the establishment of manual business procedures until such time as the required IT systems are\nrecovered.\n•Testing of systems once the IT Team has given the go ahead.\n•Communication with the clients and partners regarding their concerns.\nSummary of Business Impact Analysis (BIA)\nFor the purpose of preparing this DRP, a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) has been carried out and documented. The\nfollowing table summarises the identified critical processes along with the expected MTDs,RTOs and RPOs (for more\ndetails please refer to ).\nTITLEROLE IN PLAN\nCTOPlan Owner\nHead of InfrastructurePlan execution and testing\nDevOps LeadRecovery, restoration of services and IT configuration\nupdates\nTITLEROLE IN PLAN\nCEOBusiness Recovery -Customers point of contact\nHead of Partnership DevelopmentBusiness Recovery - Service providers point of contact\nHead of OperationsEnd-to-end testing and other operations-related tasks and\ninternal communication of the the plan.\n\nBusiness\nProcesses\nMTDRTOMinimum Business Continuity ObjectiveRPO\nAPI1 week3 daysContent can be sent to Checkstep API in order to invoke the essential\nset of AI models that provide coverage on standard set of online\nharms. A request to persist the content should be logged on a queueing\nsystem in order to make it available for consumption by the app\nfurther down the line.\n1 day\nPlatform1 week3 days\nThe application must allow access to the moderators in order to be\nable to achieve the critical path of: populating review queues with\ncontent that should be reviewed based on the configured criteria,\nfacilitating the process of the review and sending any associated\nnotifications that result from the review (e.g., sending a web-hook in\norder to disable access to the piece of content).\nAncillary workflows such as dashboards, reporting and insights can be\nrestored on a longer horizon.\n1 day\nProduction\nSupport\n1\nweek\n3 days\nThe customers must be able to contact someone at Checkstep who\ncould understand their issue and redirect the customer to the person\nwho can answer to the support request. Instead of using the ticket\nsystem, emails can be sent between people involved in the support\noperations.\nSoftware\nDevelopment\nLifecycle\n3\nmonths\n1.5\nmonths\nThe most critical part of the development process relates to the ability\nto maintain the system that is currently running. This includes the\nability to understand the current status of deployed services and take\nmanagement actions such as deployment of new version, rollback or to\nupdate infrastructure.\nThis would include the ability to make an emergency hot-fix to the\ncode in order to resolve a serious production issue, even if this\ncircumvents the full suite of static analysis tools available.\nOnce this is restored, the focus can shift to restarting the full\ndevelopment process involving the wider toolchain and beginning to\nintroduce new features.\n1 day\nApplied\nAnalytics\n2\nmonths\n1\nmonth\nA temporary pause in the development of analytical strategies such as\nnew versions of predictive models is acceptable provided the previous\nversion of the model can be restored and there is not a major drop in\nobservable accuracy. It is also important that training data captured\nas a byproduct of moderators reviewing content is still preserved such\nthat when the pipeline is back online it can be utilised for further\nimprovements.\n1 day\nCustomer\nSuccess\n1\nmonth\n1 week\nA prerequisite for completing customer service workflows is the ability\nto understand system health in the respective production environment.\nCustomer service workflows typically involve a query relating to\neither: (1) a specific piece of content, (2) a specific user or (3) a metric\nthat is tracked.\n1 day\n\nDisaster Recovery Procedures\nThe disaster recovery procedure consists of the following main phases:\n•Notification/activation phaseto detect and assess the damage and activate the plan.\n•Recovery phaseto restore temporary operations and recover damage done to the original system.\n•Recovery phaseto restore the processing capabilities of the system and return to normal operation.\nNotification and Activation Phase\nExamples of the types of disasters that would initiate this plan are natural disaster, political disturbances, human-made\ndisaster, external human threats, internal malicious activities.\nThis phase addresses the initial actions taken to detect and assess damage inflicted by a disruption to Checkstep. Based\non the assessment of the Event, sometimes according to the Checkstep Incident Response Policy, the Disaster Recovery\nPlan may be activated by the Plan Owner.\nThe notification sequence is listed below:\n•The first responder is to notify the CTO. All known information must be relayed to the CTO.\n•The CTO is to contact the rest of the team and inform them of the event. The CTO is to begin assessment\nprocedures.\n•The CTO is to notify team members and direct them to complete the assessment procedures outlined below to\ndetermine the extent of damage and estimated recovery time. If damage assessment cannot be performed\nlocally because of unsafe conditions, the CTO is to follow the steps below.\nDamage Assessment Procedures:\n•The CTO is to logically assess damage, gain insight into whether the impacted processes are salvageable, and\nbegin to formulate a plan for recovery.\nAlternate Assessment Procedures:\n•Upon notification, the CTO is to follow the procedures for damage assessment with combined DevOps and\nEngineering Teams.\n•The Checkstep Disaster Recovery Plan is to be activated if one or more of the following criteria are met:\n1.In response to a major disruptive incident that has resulted in the organization'sIncident Response\nProcedurebeing activated\n2.Any of the identified critical processes will be unavailable for more than 48 hours.\n3.Hosting facility is damaged and will be unavailable for more than 24 hours.\n•If the plan is to be activated, the CTO is to notify and inform recovery team members, using the contacts\nmention in section \"Roles, responsibilities and authorities\" , of the details of the event and if relocation is\nrequired.\nIn order to be able to perform the above investigations, queryable\naccess to the production database is required to assess state. In some\ncases it may be required to check health of messaging systems in order\nto determine if there is a lag and processing relating to one of the\nabove is still in flight.\n\n•Upon notification from the CTO, group leaders and managers are to notify their respective teams.\n•The CTO is to notify remaining personnel and executive leadership on the general status of the incident.\n•Notification can be delivered via message, email, or phone.\nRecovery Phase\nThe goal of this phase is to recover the disturbed critical processes and meet the minimum business continuity objective\ndefined in Table 1.\nRecovery Checklist\nIn the BIA study, a list of dependencies is identified and documented for each interrupted process based on which a\nchecklist of actions is prepared for recovering them. Each procedure/task should be executed in the sequence that is\npresented, to maintain efficient operations.\nOn the other hand, Business Recovery Team should follow the tasks outlined below to ensure proper communication\nwith the external parties:\n1.Contact Partners and Customers affected.\n2.Communicate with other concerned teams to set expectations.\n3.Allocate manual tasks to appropriate teams if required.\nReconstitution Phase\nOnce this plan has been implemented and the disrupted process(es) is/arerecovered, a decision will need to be made\nabout how long this situation will be required for. This will depend upon several factors including the extent of the\ndamage to the critical process(es) and how long it will be before the process gets back to normal situation.\nTop management should decide when a restoration of normal service should be attempted based on advice from all\ninvolved parties.\nA reconstitution checklist is defined per key process and documented in Appendix A.\nPlan Testing, Reviewing and Updating\nThe plan owner shall establish the validation/testing criteria for this DRP, an annual test schedule, and ensure the\nimplementation of the test. This process will also be used to train staff involved in the execution of the plan. At a\nminimum, the DRP should be tested annually. Types of validation/testing exercises include technical and tabletops\ntests.\nTabletop Testing\nThe primary objective of the tabletop test is to ensure designated personnel are knowledgeable and capable of\nperforming the notification/activation requirements and procedures as outlined in the Disaster Recovery Plan, in a\ntimely manner.For each tabletop test, the team shall ensure to go through the following steps and document:\n•Set Goals: CTO/Plan Owner shall define the goals to be achieved through the exercise (e.g. evaluating the\nviability of DRP, the preparedness of staff, or the readiness of resources and redundancies.).\n•Select the processes to be tested: CTO/Plan Owner shall determine for which key process the DRP will be\ntested.\n•Communicate with participants: all participants shall be notified formally via email. In this step observers\nmust also be identified and notified.\n•Identify and develop a disaster scenario: This can include any kind of disaster that can impact any our all\ndefined key processes (e.g. cyberattacks, ransomware, etc.).\n\n•Define some assumptions: for example, (un)availability of internet, cellular networks, staff, etc. These\nassumptions may change in every conducted test.\n•Conduct the exercise:\n◦Participants and observers are introduced,\n◦Scenario and assumptions are presented,\n◦DRP is launched and observers monitor and document participants reactions.\n•Document the post mortem: the exercise will be stopped and observers will share their recordings with others.\nAll successes, failures and changes to be made are explained and added to the final report.\nTechnical Testing\nThe primary objective of the technical test is to ensure the communication processes and data storage and recovery\nprocesses can functionto perform the functions and capabilities of the system within the designated requirements.\nTechnical testing shall include, but is not limited to:\n•Following the tests outlined in Backup Plan.\n•Test the recovery checklist per key process to ensure the feasibility of each identified task.\nReview and update\nThe Plan Owner should review the DRP at least once a year for possible updating. Examples of reasons why a review\nmay be necessary are: departure of an employee who was part of the recovery team, change in critical systems, etc.\nIn addition, after performing the above tests, Plan Owner , if necessary, should make changes to improve the DRP.\nPlan Deactivation\nThis plan must only be deactivated by the Plan Owner. In order for this plan to be deactivated, all relocation activities\nand critical service / technology tasks as detailed above must be fully completed and/or restored. If the organisation is\nstill operating in an impaired scenario, the plan may still be kept active at the discretion of the CTO. After\nreconstitution phase, all materials (hardware, software, services, etc.) used at during recovery phase should be handled\nand disposed of according to Checkstep policy.\nThepersonnel listed in \"Roles, responsibilities and authorities\" section must be notified when this plan is deactivated.\nCommunication procedure\nIt is vital that effective communications are maintained between all parties involved in the incident response.\nMeans of communication\nThe primary means of communication during an incident will be telephone, both landline and mobile. In the event of\ntelephone communications being unavailable provision may be made for the use of collaboration tools, such as Google\nMeet. Email should not be used unless telephone and equivalent alternatives are unavailable.\nCommunication guidelines\nThe following guidelines should be followed in all communications:\n•Be calm and avoid lengthy conversation,\n•Internal team members should refer information requests to the Incident Response Team,\n•If the call is answered by someone other than the contact:\n•Ask if the contact is available elsewhere,\n•If they cannot be contacted leave a message to contact, you on a given number,\n\n•Do not provide details of the Incident,\n•Always document call time details, responses and actions.\nAll communications shall be recovered in a dedicated space in Confluence.\nExternal communication\nDepending on the incident there may be a variety of external parties that will be communicated with during the\nresponse. It is important that the information released to third parties is managed so that it is timely and accurate.\nCalls that are not from agencies directly involved in the incident response (such as the media) should be passed to the\nmember of the IRT responsible for communications.\nEmergency responders such as the police, fire and ambulance services will be well practised in incident handling and\nwill have their own structured methods for communication and every effort should be made to comply with these.\nInformation flow and documentation processes\nDuring a disaster it is vital that information flows effectively around the response teams and that certain processes are\nfollowed to ensure that actions and messages are recorded correctly.\nIf theIncident Response Procedurehas been activated, then regular updates on the situation should be given to the IRT.\nThe frequency of these updates will be specified by the IRT Leader. Within the recovery teams, the Plan Owner will\ndecide how often progress/status updates should be given and is responsible for co-ordination between the IT Recovery\nand Business Recovery teams. Actions that are decided upon as a result of progress meetings should be recorded using\nConfluence dedicated space.\nAppendix A - Reconstitution Checklists\n\nAPI\nPlatform\nTask

Volume encryption key material is protected with access controls such that the key material is only\naccessible by privileged accounts.\nAccess\nCheckstep employee access to production is guarded by an approval process and by default is disabled. When access is\napproved, temporary access is granted that allows access to production. Production access is reviewed by the security\nteam on a case by case basis.\nSeparation\nCustomer data is logically separated at the database/datastore level using a unique identifier for the customer. The\nseparation is enforced at the API layer where the client must authenticate with a chosen account and then the customer\nunique identifier is included in the access token and used by the API to restrict access to data to the account. All\ndatabase/datastore queries then include the account identifier.\nMonitoring\nCheckstep uses AWS CloudWatch to monitor the entire cloud service operation. If a system failure and alarm is\ntriggered, key personnel are notified by text, chat, and/or email message in order to take appropriate corrective action.\nCheckstep uses a security agent to monitor production systems. The agents monitor system activities, generate alerts on\nsuspicious activities and report on vulnerability findings to a centralized management console.\nData At Rest\nEncryption\n\nAll databases, data stores, and file systems are encrypted according to Checkstep'sEncryption Policy.\nRetention\nStored data must be properly categorized and a retention schedule applied accordingly in conjunction with Checkstep's\nAsset Management Policy,Data Classification PolicyandData Deletion Policy. Considerations for retention\ntimeframe include:\n•Statutory, regulatory or contractual requirements\n•Type of data (e.g., accounting records, database records, audit logs)\n•Type of storage media (e.g., paper, hard drive, server)\nStorage and Disposal\nStored data must be properly stored and handled while at rest. Considerations for storage and disposal of data at rest in\nconjunction with Checkstep'sAsset Management Policy,Data Classification PolicyandData Deletion Policyinclude:\n•Authorization to access or manage stored data\n•Proper identification of records and their retention period\n•Technology change and ability to access data throughout retention period\n•Acceptable timeframe and format to retrieve data\n•Appropriate methods of disposal\nData In Transit\nNecessity\nData will only be transferred where strictly necessary for effective business processes.\nTransfer Factors\nBefore choosing the method of data transfer, the following must be considered:\n•Nature, sensitivity, confidentiality, and value of the information\n•Size of data being transferred\n•Impact of loss during transit\nEncryption\nTo ensure the safety of data in transit:\n•All external data transmission must be encrypted end-to-end using encryption keys managed by Checkstep.\nThis includes, but is not limited to, cloud infrastructure and third party vendors and applications.\n•All internet and intranet connections are encrypted and authenticated using a strong protocol, a strong key\nexchange, and a strong cipher.\nEnd-user Messaging Channels\n•Restricted and sensitive data is not allowed to be sent over electronic end-user messaging channels such as\nemail or chat, unless end-to-end encryption is enabled.\n•Messages must be protected from unauthorized access, modification or denial of service commensurate with\n\nthe classification scheme adopted by the organization.\n•Messages must be reviewed prior to sending to ensure correct addressing and transportation of the message.\n•The reliability and availability of the messaging channel must be verified.\n•All applicable legal requirements will be adhered to.\n•Use of external public services such as instant messaging, social networking or file sharing will require prior\napproval and authorization.\n•Publicly accessible networks will be controlled by stronger authentication.\nRevision History\nVersionDateEditorDescription of Changes\n1.008-09-2021Tuan LeInitial Creation\n1.1.27 Oct 2023Vilius Pankauskasno changes\n1.121 Nov 2024Vilius Pankauskasno changes\n\nPolicy version history\nPolicy details\nPolicy name\nData Protection Policy\nRenewal date\nDecember 1, 2025\nDescription\nThe Data Protection policy outlines many of the procedures and technical controls in support of data protection.\nVersion history\nVersion 1\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nSeptember 8, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 2\nExplanation of changes\nsome policies are added\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nDecember 8, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 3\nExplanation of changes\nEvent Logs is moved to Operations Security Policy\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nDecember 15, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\n\nVersion 4\nExplanation of changes\n\"Checkstep hosts on AWS in the EU-West-1 (Ireland) region by default.

Access by any other entity is allowable only on a minimum\nnecessary basis. All users are responsible for reporting an incident of unauthorized use or access of the organization's\ninformation systems.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this procedure is to provide a policy and guideline for creating, modifying, or removing access to the\ncompany's network and data by creating, changing or deleting the network account configuration for a User.\nRoles and responsibilities\nThe Chief Information Security Officer is responsible for updating, reviewing, and maintaining this policy.\nScope\nThis policy and defined process is used to allow access to the company's data and systems to individuals who meet the\nrequirements defined in this policy. This policy governs individuals who are granted access that is necessary to support\nthe business. This policy relates to all data used, processed, stored, maintained, or transmitted in and through the\ncompany's systems.\nAccess Establishment and Modification\nRequests for access to Checkstep Platform systems and applications are made formally using the following process:\n\n1.A Checkstep workforce member initiates the access request by creating an Issue in the Checkstep ticketing\nsystem.\na.User identities must be verified prior to granting access to new accounts.\nb.Identity verification must be done in person where possible; for remote employees, identities must\nbe verified over the phone or through a video call.\nc.For new accounts, the method used to verify the user's identity must be recorded on the Issue.\n2.The Security Officer will grant or reject access to systems as dictated by the employee's job title. If additional\naccess is required outside of the minimum necessary to perform job functions, the requester must include a\ndescription of why the additional access is required as part of the access request.\n3.If the request is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.\n4.If the review is approved, the request is marked as \"Done\", and any pertinent notes are added.\nAccess Reviews\nAll access to Checkstep systems and services is reviewed and updated on an annual basis to ensure proper\nauthorizations are in place commensurate with job functions. The process for conducting reviews is outlined below:\n1.The Security Officer initiates the review of user access by creating an Issue in the Checkstep Ticketing\nSystem\n2.The Security Officer is assigned to review levels of access for each Checkstep workforce member.\n3.If user access is found during review that is not in line with the least privilege principle, the Security Officer\nmay modify user access and notify the user of access changes.\n4.Once the review is complete, the Security Officer then marks the ticket as \"Done\", adding any pertinent notes\nrequired.\nWorkforce Clearance\n•The level of security assigned to a user to the organization's information systems is based on the minimum\nnecessary amount of data access required to carry out legitimate job responsibilities assigned to a user's job\nclassification.\n•All access requests are treated on a\"least-access and need-to-know principles.\"\n•Checkstep maintains a minimum necessary approach to access to Customer data.\nUnique User Identification\n•Access to the Checkstep Platform systems and applications is controlled by requiring unique User Login IDs\nand passwords for each individual user and developer.\n•Passwords requirements mandate strong password controls.\n•Passwords are not displayed at any time and are not transmitted or stored in plain text.\n•Default accounts on all production systems, including root, are disabled.\n•Shared accounts are not allowed within Checkstep systems or networks.\n•Automated log-on configurations other than the company's approved Password Management provider that\nstore user passwords or bypass password entry are not permitted for use with Checkstep workstations or\nproduction systems.\nAutomatic Logoff\n•Users are required to make information systems inaccessible by any other individual when unattended by the\nusers (ex. by using a password protected screen saver or logging off the system).\n\nAccess Removal\n•All user IDs that have been inactive for thirty (30) days will be revoked unless specifically authorized by the\ncompany leadership.\n•In response to feedback from management, systems administrators must promptly revoke all privileges no\nlonger needed by users.\nEmployee Devices Usage\nDevices include workstations and mobile devices items such as laptops, notebooks, tablet devices, smartphones and\nsmart watches.\nThe workstations/laptops or other mobile device that at Checkstep are either company owned, or owned by the\nemployee following the BYOD requirement below. An organization-provided device must be used primarily for\nCheckstep-related business purposes and shall be protected.\n•Mobile endpoint devices must meet the requirements for use as stated in theAcceptable Use PolicyandAsset\nManagement Policy.\n•Classified information:The storage, transmission and processing of Checkstep classified information should\nbe primarily done on mobile devices provided by the organization. If not possible, personal device can be\nused if specifically authorized by Checkstep security services,and the BYOD Requirements below have been\nfulfilled.\n•Physical integrity:precautions to protect all mobile devices and computer media must be taken. For example,\nusers should not leave a laptop unattended or on display in a car such that it would encourage an opportunist\ntheft.\n•No peripheral:Checkstep does not provide to its employees any storage media or peripherals. Ask approval\nfrom Checkstep IT services or Security Officer if adding or using personal peripheral hardware to store and\ntransport business related information is required.\n•Encryption: The device will be secured so that all of the data on it is encrypted and so is only accessible if the\npassword is known. If the device is supplied with encryption, do not disable it.\n•Firewalls: Devices must have firewalls enabled to prevent unauthorized network access unless an exemption\nhas been granted by Checkstep security services.\n•Malware protection:Personal or company-provided device will be protected by organization-supplied anti-\nmalware software. Attempting to disable anti-malware protection constitute of breach of this Policy.\n•Adding malware/viruses: It is a breach of company Policy to introduce viruses or other malware into the\nsystem or network, for example by inserting unknown peripherals or media into a device containing company\ninformation.\n•If browser add-ons are approved and installed, a browser testing tool shall be run to ensure the security of the\nadd-on.\n•Stolen mobile devices must immediately be reported to the Security Officer using email or by creating a ticket\nin Jira.\nBring Your Own Device (BYOD) Requirements\nBYOD is the concept of employees using their personally owned device for work purposes. With BYOD, an Checkstep\nhas ownership of the corporate data and resources that may be accessed or stored on a device, but the device itself is the\nproperty of the user.\n•Employees must install Drata agent on their device, and ensure that all the associated controls are successful\npassed. In particular, it ensures that the password is approved, the hard-disk is encrypted, the appropriate anti-\nvirus/anti-malware is installed, the automatic updates are activated and the screen saver is locked.\n•Employee must activate a firewall approved by the Security Officer on their device.\n•Since checkstep uses only Cloud service for content generation and sharing (i.e. Google Workspace and\nConfluence), the employees should avoid downloading and storing any documents on their local machines\n\nwhere possible as a security precaution. If it is necessary to download any files on the local machine, the\nemployee shall download these files in dedicated folder for Checkstep and clearly labelled as such.\n•In the event of the device being lost or stolen, the owner must inform the Security Officer through\nsecurity@checkstep.com and a Jira ticket must be created, giving details of the circumstances of the loss and\nthe sensitivity of the business information stored on it.\n•Upon leaving the organization, the device owner must allow the device to be audited and all business-related\ndata and applications removed.\nRevision History\nVersionDateEditorDescription of Changes\n0.110-Sep-2021Tuan LeInitial Creation\n0.214-Dec-2021Guillaume BouchardUpdated BYOD\n0.34-Jan-2022Guillaume BouchardEmployee Devices Usage\n0.48-Nov-2022Vilius PankauskasAdding responsibilities section\n0.47th Nov 2023Vilius Pankauskasno significant change\n0.418 Nov 2024Vilius Pankauskasno changes\n\nPolicy version history\nPolicy details\nPolicy name\nSystem Access Control Policy\nRenewal date\nDecember 1, 2025\nDescription\nThe System Access Control Policy defines procedures to onboard and offboard users to technical infrastructure in a manner that\nminimizes the risk of information loss or exposure.\nVersion history\nVersion 1\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 9, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 2\nExplanation of changes\nBring Your Own Device (BYOD) Requirements is added\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nDecember 7, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 3\nExplanation of changes\nBYOD policy\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nDecember 14, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\n\nVersion 4\nExplanation of changes\nOffboarding procedure is extracted and transferred to HR policy\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nDecember 15, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 5\nExplanation of changes\nAccess Removal section added\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nJanuary 4, 2022February 10, 2022Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 6\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 8, 2022November 23, 2022Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 7\nExplanation of changes\nyearly policies review\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 30, 2023November 30, 2023Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas\nVersion 8\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 18, 2024November 18, 2024Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"result\": \"Valid\",\n  \"details\": []\n}"}]}

It should be noted that the sensitivity level definitions were created as guidelines and to emphasize\ncommon sense steps that you can take to protect sensitive or confidential information (e.g., Company Confidential\ninformation should not be left unattended in conference rooms).\nScope\nInformation covered in this policy includes, but is not limited to, information that is received, stored, processed, or\ntransmitted via any means. This includes electronic, hardcopy, and any other form of information regardless of the\nmedia on which it resides.\nRoles and Responsibilities\nUpdating, reviewing, and maintaining this policy: CEO\nClassifying data: CISO\nLabeling data and assets: All employees\nPolicy\nData Classification Scheme\nData classification, in the context of information security, is the classification of data based on its level of sensitivity\n\nCLASSIFICATIONDATA CLASSIFICATION DESCRIPTION\nRESTRICTED\nDefinition\nRestricted information is highly valuable, highly sensitive business information\nand the level of protection is dictated externally by legal and/or contractual\nrequirements. Restricted information must be limited to only authorized\nemployees, contractors, and business partners with a specific business need.\nPotential\nImpact of\nSIGNIFICANT DAMAGEwould occur if Restricted information were to\nbecome available to unauthorized parties either internal or external to Checkstep.\nImpact could include negatively affecting Checkstep's competitive position,\nand the impact to Checkstep should that data be disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization. The\nclassification of data helps determine what baseline security controls are appropriate for safeguarding that data. All data\nshould be classified into one of the three following classifications.\nConfidential/Restricted Data\nData should be classified as Restricted or Confidential when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of\nthat data could cause a serious or significant level of risk to Checkstep or its customers. Examples of Sensitive data\ninclude data protected by state or federal privacy regulations (e.g. PHI & PII) and data protected by confidentiality\nagreements. The highest level of security controls should be applied to Restricted and Confidential Data:\n•Disclosure or access to Restricted and Confidential data is limited to specific use by individuals with a\nlegitimate need-to-know. Explicit authorization by the Security Officer is required for access to data because\nof legal, contractual, privacy, or other constraints.\n•Must be protected to prevent loss, theft, unauthorized access, and/or unauthorized disclosure.\n•Must be destroyed when no longer needed. Destruction must be in accordance with Company policies and\nprocedures.\n•Will require specific methodologies, procedures, and reporting requirements for the response and handling of\nincidents.\nInternal Use Data\nData should be classified as Internal Use when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data could\nresult in a moderate level of risk to Checkstep or its customers. This includes proprietary, ethical, or privacy\nconsiderations. Data must be protected from unauthorized access, modification, transmission, storage or other use. This\napplies even though there may not be a civil statute requiring this protection. Internal Use Data is restricted to\npersonnel who have a legitimate reason to access it. By default, all data that is not explicitly classified as Restricted/\nConfidential or Public data should be treated as Internal Use data. A reasonable level of security controls should be\napplied to Internal Use Data.\nPublic Data\nData should be classified as Public when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration or destruction of that data would result\nin little or no risk to Checkstep and its customers. It is further defined as information with no existing local, national, or\ninternational legal restrictions on access or usage. While little or no controls are required to protect the confidentiality\nof Public data, some level of control is required to prevent unauthorized alteration or destruction of Public Data.\nAssessing Classification Level and Labeling\nThe goal of information security, as stated in the Information Security Policy, is to protect the confidentiality, integrity,\nand availability of Corporate and Customer Data. Data classification reflects the level of impact to Checkstep if\nconfidentiality, integrity, or availability is compromised. If a classification is not inherently obvious, consider each\nsecurity objective using the following table as a guide.All data are to be assigned one of the following four sensitivity\nlevels:\n\nLossviolating regulatory requirements, damaging the company's reputation, violating\ncontractual requirements, and posing an identity theft risk.\nCONFIDENTIAL\nDefinition\nConfidential information is highly valuable, sensitive business\ninformation and the level of protection is dictated internally by Checkstep.\nPotential\nImpact of\nLoss\nSIGNIFICANT DAMAGEwould occur if Confidential information were to\nbecome available to unauthorized parties either internal or external to Checkstep.\nImpact could include negatively affecting Checkstep's competitive position,\ndamaging the company's reputation, violating contractual requirements, and\nexposing geographic location of individuals.\nINTERNAL USE\nDefinition\nInternal Use information is information originating within or owned by\nCheckstep, or entrusted to it by others. Internal Use information may be shared\nwith authorized employees, contractors, and business partners who have a\nbusiness need, but may not be released to the general public, due to the negative\nimpact it might have on the company's business interests.\nPotential\nImpact of\nLoss\nMODERATE DAMAGEwould occur if Internal Use information were to\nbecome available to unauthorized parties either internal or external to Checkstep.\nImpact could include damaging the company's reputation and violating\ncontractual requirements.\nPUBLIC\nDefinitionPublic information is information that has been approved for release to the\ngeneral public and is freely shareable both internally and externally.\nPotential\nImpact of\nLoss\nNO DAMAGEwould occur if Public information were to become available to\nparties either internal or external to Checkstep. Impact would not be damaging or\na risk to business operations.\n\nHANDLING CONTROLS PER DATA CLASSIFICATION\nHandling\nControls\nRestrictedConfidentialInternal

Security controls, including authentication, authorization, data\nencryption, and auditing, should be applied according to the highest classification of data in a given\nrepository.\n•Employees shall not have direct administrative access to production data during normal business operations.\nExceptions include emergency operations such as forensic analysis and manual disaster recovery.\n•All Production Systems must disable services that are not required to achieve the business purpose or function\nof the system.\n•All access to Production Systems must be logged.\n•All Production Systems must have security monitoring enabled, including activity and file integrity\nmonitoring, vulnerability scanning, and/or malware detection, as applicable.\nData Protection Implementation and Processes\nCustomerData Protection\nAll Checkstep employees adhere to the following processes to reduce the risk of compromising Production Data:\n•Implement and/or review controls designed to protect Production Data from improper alteration or\ndestruction.\n•Ensure that confidential data is stored in a manner that supports user access logs and automated monitoring\nfor potential security incidents.\n•Ensure Checkstep Customer Production Data is segmented and only accessible to Customer authorized to\naccess data.\n•All Production Data at rest is stored on encrypted volumes using encryption keys managed by Checkstep.\n•Volume encryption keys and machines that generate volume encryption keys are protected from unauthorized\naccess. Volume encryption key material is protected with access controls such that the key material is only\naccessible by privileged accounts.\nAccess\nCheckstep employee access to production is guarded by an approval process and by default is disabled. When access is\napproved, temporary access is granted that allows access to production. Production access is reviewed by the security\nteam on a case by case basis.\nSeparation\nCustomer data is logically separated at the database/datastore level using a unique identifier for the customer. The\nseparation is enforced at the API layer where the client must authenticate with a chosen account and then the customer\nunique identifier is included in the access token and used by the API to restrict access to data to the account. All\ndatabase/datastore queries then include the account identifier.\nMonitoring\nCheckstep uses AWS CloudWatch to monitor the entire cloud service operation. If a system failure and alarm is\ntriggered, key personnel are notified by text, chat, and/or email message in order to take appropriate corrective action.\nCheckstep uses a security agent to monitor production systems. The agents monitor system activities, generate alerts on\nsuspicious activities and report on vulnerability findings to a centralized management console.\nData At Rest\nEncryption\n\nAll databases, data stores, and file systems are encrypted according to Checkstep'sEncryption Policy.\nRetention\nStored data must be properly categorized and a retention schedule applied accordingly in conjunction with Checkstep's\nAsset Management Policy,Data Classification PolicyandData Deletion Policy. Considerations for retention\ntimeframe include:\n•Statutory, regulatory or contractual requirements\n•Type of data (e.g., accounting records, database records, audit logs)\n•Type of storage media (e.g., paper, hard drive, server)\nStorage and Disposal\nStored data must be properly stored and handled while at rest. Considerations for storage and disposal of data at rest in\nconjunction with Checkstep'sAsset Management Policy,Data Classification PolicyandData Deletion Policyinclude:\n•Authorization to access or manage stored data\n•Proper identification of records and their retention period\n•Technology change and ability to access data throughout retention period\n•Acceptable timeframe and format to retrieve data\n•Appropriate methods of disposal\nData In Transit\nNecessity\nData will only be transferred where strictly necessary for effective business processes.\nTransfer Factors\nBefore choosing the method of data transfer, the following must be considered:\n•Nature, sensitivity, confidentiality, and value of the information\n•Size of data being transferred\n•Impact of loss during transit\nEncryption\nTo ensure the safety of data in transit:\n•All external data transmission must be encrypted end-to-end using encryption keys managed by Checkstep.\nThis includes, but is not limited to, cloud infrastructure and third party vendors and applications.\n•All internet and intranet connections are encrypted and authenticated using a strong protocol, a strong key\nexchange, and a strong cipher.\nEnd-user Messaging Channels\n•Restricted and sensitive data is not allowed to be sent over electronic end-user messaging channels such as\nemail or chat, unless end-to-end encryption is enabled.\n•Messages must be protected from unauthorized access, modification or denial of service commensurate with\n\nthe classification scheme adopted by the organization.\n•Messages must be reviewed prior to sending to ensure correct addressing and transportation of the message.\n•The reliability and availability of the messaging channel must be verified.\n•All applicable legal requirements will be adhered to.\n•Use of external public services such as instant messaging, social networking or file sharing will require prior\napproval and authorization.\n•Publicly accessible networks will be controlled by stronger authentication.\nRevision History\nVersionDateEditorDescription of Changes\n1.008-09-2021Tuan LeInitial Creation\n1.1.27 Oct 2023Vilius Pankauskasno changes\n1.121 Nov 2024Vilius Pankauskasno changes\n\nPolicy version history\nPolicy details\nPolicy name\nData Protection Policy\nRenewal date\nDecember 1, 2025\nDescription\nThe Data Protection policy outlines many of the procedures and technical controls in support of data protection.\nVersion history\nVersion 1\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nSeptember 8, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 2\nExplanation of changes\nsome policies are added\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nDecember 8, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 3\nExplanation of changes\nEvent Logs is moved to Operations Security Policy\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nDecember 15, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\n\nVersion 4\nExplanation of changes\n\"Checkstep hosts on AWS in the EU-West-1 (Ireland) region by default.

Checkstep will manage all system and application changes\nsubject to this policy (e.g. operating system, computing hardware, networks, applications, data centers) in accordance\nwith the applicable change management procedures.\nProcedures\nThe objective of this process is to manage the introduction of any change into production by ensuring that the correct\nprocedures are being followed, proper documentation has been completed, proper testing has been performed, and\nproper approval is in place.\nOrganizational Change Control\nThe following procedures apply to all changes, including infrastructure, code, and networking changes, as well as the\ndeployment of new hardware:\n•A record of agreed authorization levels will be maintained.\n•Changes are only submitted by authorized users.\n•Controls and integrity procedures will be reviewed to ensure that they will not be compromised by the\nchanges.\n•Security critical code to minimize the likelihood of known security weaknesses will be identified and\nchecked.\n•Formal approval must be obtained for detailed proposals before work begins.\n•Changes will be implemented at a time that is least intrusive to business processes involved.\n•Vendor-supplied software will be used without modification; in the event that a modification is necessary, the\nfollowing will be evaluated:\n◦Risk of compromising built-in controls and integrity processes\n◦Vendor consent\n◦Getting the modifications from vendor as standard updates\n◦Impact of owning the responsibility for maintaining the program\n◦Compatibility with other software in use.\n•A technical review of applications will be conducted after changes to operating platforms (operating systems,\ndatabases and middleware platforms). The review will include:\n\n◦Application control and integrity procedures to ensure that they have not been compromised by the\noperating platform changes.\n◦Timely notification of operating platform changes to allow appropriate tests and reviews to take\nplace before implementation.\n◦Appropriate changes are made to the business continuity plans.\n•Customers must be notified of major changes (new subprocessor, etc.) or changes that may lead to system\ndowntime, at least 2 business days prior to their deployment to the production environment.\nPlanned Changes\nFor planned changes, Checkstep will:\n•Plan the implementation and assign tasks, responsibilities, deadlines and resources using the internal changes\ntracking system;\n•For the significant changes that impact the product on a deeper level the Architecture Decision Record (ADR)\nwill be filed in the ADR catalog;\n•Implement changes according to the plan;\n•Monitor the implementation to confirm that they are implemented according to the plan.\nUnplanned Changes\nFor observed unintended changes, Checkstep will:\n•Review consequences of the changes;\n•Evaluate the occurrence or potential for occurrence of any adverse effects;\n•Plan and implement actions to mitigate any adverse effects as necessary;\n•In the case of Emergency Changes (e.g., when a critical vulnerability is discovered and needs to be resolved\nimmediately), an expedited process may be conducted.\nSoftware Development\nFor software development, operating system applications and software changes will only be implemented after\nextensive and successful testing:\n•The tests will cover:\n◦Usability\n◦Security\n◦Effects on other systems\n◦Tests will be conducted on separate systems (test environment), and all corresponding program\nsource libraries will also be updated, as appropriate.\n•The operational software, applications and program libraries of Checkstep will only be updated by trained\nadministrators upon appropriate management authorization.\n•Company operational systems will only hold approved executable code, not development code or compilers.\n•A configuration control system will be used to keep control of all implemented software as well as the system\ndocumentation.\n◦Previous versions of software will be retained as a contingency measure.\n◦Old versions of software will be archived, together with all required information and parameters,\nprocedures, configuration details and supporting software for as long as the data are retained in the\narchive.\n•There will be a rollback strategy in place before changes are implemented.\n•An audit log will be maintained of all updates to operational program libraries.\n\nVersionDateEditorDescription of Changes\n•All decisions to upgrade to a new version release must take into account:\n◦Business requirements for the change\n◦Security of the release, e.g. the introduction of new information security functionality or the number\nand severity of information security problems affecting this version.\n•Change security measures will be in place, to include:\n◦Branch protection rules (Gitlab);\n◦Review & approval from the security team in case of significant changes;\n◦Changes deployed to production only by specifically authorized personnel with escalated privileges;\nand,\n◦Post deployment QA testing to ensure the change is functioning as intended in the production\nenvironment.\nSupplier Services\nManagement of changes to supplier services is covered in theVendor Management Policyin the Policy Center.\nConfiguration Management\nFor configuration management, production and system network changes will only be implemented with properly\nconducted procedures:\n•Terraform and Gitlab are used to standardize and automate configuration management.\n•No systems are deployed into Checkstep environments without approval of the Checkstep CTO or\nEngineering Manager.\n•All changes to production systems, network devices, and firewalls are approved by the Checkstep Checkstep\nCTO or Engineering Manager before they are implemented to assure they comply with business and security\nrequirements.\n•All changes to production systems are tested before they are implemented in production.\n•Implementation of approved changes are only performed by authorized personnel.\n•Tooling to generate an up-to-date inventory of systems, including corresponding architecture diagrams for\nrelated products and services, is hosted on Gitlab in the form of Terraform Code.\n•All frontend functionality (developer dashboards and portals) is separated from backend (database and app\nservers) systems by being deployed on separate servers or containers.\n•All committed code is reviewed using pull requests to assure software code quality and proactively detect\npotential security issues in development.\n•Checkstep utilizes development and staging environments that mirror production to assure proper function.\n•All formal change requests require unique ID and authentication.\n•Identities assigned to multiple persons (e.g. shared identities) are only permitted where they are necessary for\nbusiness or operational reasons and are subject to dedicated approval and documentation.\n•Clocks are continuously synchronized to an authoritative source across all systems using a single reference\ntime source.

Records of findings must be retained for at least 2 years.\nThe scanning and identification of Checkstep's system vulnerabilities is performed by:\n•Automated Drata security agent installed on all employees' machines.\n•AWS Inspector for infrastructure and AWS ECR vulnerability scanner for images\nAdditionally, periodic security scans of Checkstep systems are done using a combination of external open-source and\ncommercial vulnerability testing tools, including but not limited to:\n•Container Analysis performs vulnerability scans on images in artifact registry\n•Secrets scanning in the code base\n•Dependency scanning automatically finds security vulnerabilities in software dependencies. For example,\nGitLab dependency scanning is interopable with Python package managers using a tool called Gemnasium.\nUser Interface applications using JavaScript can have dependencies scanned using a tool such as Retire.js\nPenetration Testing\nInternal penetration tests are done regularly as the product is being developed by Checkstep security team utilising\nautomated and manual processes. Penetration testing is performed by a certified penetration tester from an independent\nthird party at least once every two years or upon Checkstep's client request, whichever comes sooner.\nFindings from a vulnerability scan and/or penetration test are analyzed by the Security Officer, together with IT and\nEngineering as needed, and reported through the process defined in the next section.\nSecurity Findings Reporting, Tracking and Remediation\nCheckstep follows a simple vulnerability tracking process using Jira. The records of findings are retained for minimal 2\nyears.\nReporting a Finding\n•Upon identification of a vulnerability (including vulnerability in software, system, or process), a Jira ticket is\ncreated.\n•The description of the Finding should include further details, without any confidential information, and a link\nto the source.\n•The Finding will be given a priority level in Jira\nPriority/Severity Ratings and Service Level Agreements\nIn an effort to quickly remediate security vulnerabilities, the following timelines have been put in place to address\n\nPriority\nLevel\nSLADefinitionExamples\nCritical24HVulnerabilities that cause a privilege escalation on\nthe platform from unprivileged to admin, allows\nremote code execution, financial theft, unauthorized\naccess to/extraction of sensitive data, etc.\nVulnerabilities that result in Remote\nCode Execution such as Vertical\nAuthentication bypass, SSRF, XXE,\nSQL Injection, User authentication\nbypass\nHigh5\ndays\nVulnerabilities that affect the security of the platform\nincluding the processes it supports.\nLateral authentication bypass, Stored\nXSS, some CSRF depending on impact\nMediumBest\neffort\nVulnerabilities that affect multiple users, and require\nlittle or no user interaction to trigger\nReflective XSS, Direct object reference,\nURL Redirect, some CSRF depending\non impact\nLowBest\neffort\nIssues that affect singular users and require\ninteraction or significant prerequisites (MitM) to\ntrigger.\nCommon flaws, Debug information,\nMixed Content\nvulnerabilities:\nIn the case a severity rating and/or priority level is updated after a vulnerability finding was originally created, the SLA\nis updated as follow:\n•Priority upgrade: reset SLA from time of escalation\n•Priority downgrade: SLA time remains the same from time of creation/identification of finding\nResolving a Finding\n•The Finding should be assigned to the owner responsible for the system or software package.\n•All findings should be addressed according to the established SLA.\n•No software should be deployed to production with unresolved CRITICAL or HIGH findings, unless an\nException is in place (see below).\n•A finding may be resolved by\n1.providing a valid fix/mitigation\n2.determining as a false positive\n3.documenting an approved exception\nClosing a Finding\n•The assignee should provide a valid resolution (see above) and add a comment to the finding.\n•The finding should be re-assigned to the Reporter or a member of the security team for validation.\n•Upon validation, the finding can be marked as Done (closed) by the Reporter.\n•Before the finding can be marked as closed by the reporter, the fix must be deployed to a development\nenvironment and have a targeted release date for deploying to production noted on the ticket.\nExceptions\n•An Exception may be requested when a viable or direct fix to a vulnerability is not available. For example, a\nversion of the package that contains the fix is not supported on the particular operating system in use.\n•An alternative solution (a.k.a. compensating control) must be in place to address the original vulnerability\nsuch that the risk is mitigated.

Access by any other entity is allowable only on a minimum\nnecessary basis. All users are responsible for reporting an incident of unauthorized use or access of the organization's\ninformation systems.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this procedure is to provide a policy and guideline for creating, modifying, or removing access to the\ncompany's network and data by creating, changing or deleting the network account configuration for a User.\nRoles and responsibilities\nThe Chief Information Security Officer is responsible for updating, reviewing, and maintaining this policy.\nScope\nThis policy and defined process is used to allow access to the company's data and systems to individuals who meet the\nrequirements defined in this policy. This policy governs individuals who are granted access that is necessary to support\nthe business. This policy relates to all data used, processed, stored, maintained, or transmitted in and through the\ncompany's systems.\nAccess Establishment and Modification\nRequests for access to Checkstep Platform systems and applications are made formally using the following process:\n\n1.A Checkstep workforce member initiates the access request by creating an Issue in the Checkstep ticketing\nsystem.\na.User identities must be verified prior to granting access to new accounts.\nb.Identity verification must be done in person where possible; for remote employees, identities must\nbe verified over the phone or through a video call.\nc.For new accounts, the method used to verify the user's identity must be recorded on the Issue.\n2.The Security Officer will grant or reject access to systems as dictated by the employee's job title. If additional\naccess is required outside of the minimum necessary to perform job functions, the requester must include a\ndescription of why the additional access is required as part of the access request.\n3.If the request is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.\n4.If the review is approved, the request is marked as \"Done\", and any pertinent notes are added.\nAccess Reviews\nAll access to Checkstep systems and services is reviewed and updated on an annual basis to ensure proper\nauthorizations are in place commensurate with job functions. The process for conducting reviews is outlined below:\n1.The Security Officer initiates the review of user access by creating an Issue in the Checkstep Ticketing\nSystem\n2.The Security Officer is assigned to review levels of access for each Checkstep workforce member.\n3.If user access is found during review that is not in line with the least privilege principle, the Security Officer\nmay modify user access and notify the user of access changes.\n4.Once the review is complete, the Security Officer then marks the ticket as \"Done\", adding any pertinent notes\nrequired.\nWorkforce Clearance\n•The level of security assigned to a user to the organization's information systems is based on the minimum\nnecessary amount of data access required to carry out legitimate job responsibilities assigned to a user's job\nclassification.\n•All access requests are treated on a\"least-access and need-to-know principles.\"\n•Checkstep maintains a minimum necessary approach to access to Customer data.\nUnique User Identification\n•Access to the Checkstep Platform systems and applications is controlled by requiring unique User Login IDs\nand passwords for each individual user and developer.\n•Passwords requirements mandate strong password controls.\n•Passwords are not displayed at any time and are not transmitted or stored in plain text.\n•Default accounts on all production systems, including root, are disabled.\n•Shared accounts are not allowed within Checkstep systems or networks.\n•Automated log-on configurations other than the company's approved Password Management provider that\nstore user passwords or bypass password entry are not permitted for use with Checkstep workstations or\nproduction systems.\nAutomatic Logoff\n•Users are required to make information systems inaccessible by any other individual when unattended by the\nusers (ex. by using a password protected screen saver or logging off the system).\n\nAccess Removal\n•All user IDs that have been inactive for thirty (30) days will be revoked unless specifically authorized by the\ncompany leadership.\n•In response to feedback from management, systems administrators must promptly revoke all privileges no\nlonger needed by users.\nEmployee Devices Usage\nDevices include workstations and mobile devices items such as laptops, notebooks, tablet devices, smartphones and\nsmart watches.\nThe workstations/laptops or other mobile device that at Checkstep are either company owned, or owned by the\nemployee following the BYOD requirement below. An organization-provided device must be used primarily for\nCheckstep-related business purposes and shall be protected.\n•Mobile endpoint devices must meet the requirements for use as stated in theAcceptable Use PolicyandAsset\nManagement Policy.\n•Classified information:The storage, transmission and processing of Checkstep classified information should\nbe primarily done on mobile devices provided by the organization. If not possible, personal device can be\nused if specifically authorized by Checkstep security services,and the BYOD Requirements below have been\nfulfilled.\n•Physical integrity:precautions to protect all mobile devices and computer media must be taken. For example,\nusers should not leave a laptop unattended or on display in a car such that it would encourage an opportunist\ntheft.\n•No peripheral:Checkstep does not provide to its employees any storage media or peripherals. Ask approval\nfrom Checkstep IT services or Security Officer if adding or using personal peripheral hardware to store and\ntransport business related information is required.\n•Encryption: The device will be secured so that all of the data on it is encrypted and so is only accessible if the\npassword is known. If the device is supplied with encryption, do not disable it.\n•Firewalls: Devices must have firewalls enabled to prevent unauthorized network access unless an exemption\nhas been granted by Checkstep security services.\n•Malware protection:Personal or company-provided device will be protected by organization-supplied anti-\nmalware software. Attempting to disable anti-malware protection constitute of breach of this Policy.\n•Adding malware/viruses: It is a breach of company Policy to introduce viruses or other malware into the\nsystem or network, for example by inserting unknown peripherals or media into a device containing company\ninformation.\n•If browser add-ons are approved and installed, a browser testing tool shall be run to ensure the security of the\nadd-on.\n•Stolen mobile devices must immediately be reported to the Security Officer using email or by creating a ticket\nin Jira.\nBring Your Own Device (BYOD) Requirements\nBYOD is the concept of employees using their personally owned device for work purposes. With BYOD, an Checkstep\nhas ownership of the corporate data and resources that may be accessed or stored on a device, but the device itself is the\nproperty of the user.\n•Employees must install Drata agent on their device, and ensure that all the associated controls are successful\npassed. In particular, it ensures that the password is approved, the hard-disk is encrypted, the appropriate anti-\nvirus/anti-malware is installed, the automatic updates are activated and the screen saver is locked.\n•Employee must activate a firewall approved by the Security Officer on their device.\n•Since checkstep uses only Cloud service for content generation and sharing (i.e. Google Workspace and\nConfluence), the employees should avoid downloading and storing any documents on their local machines\n\nwhere possible as a security precaution. If it is necessary to download any files on the local machine, the\nemployee shall download these files in dedicated folder for Checkstep and clearly labelled as such.\n•In the event of the device being lost or stolen, the owner must inform the Security Officer through\nsecurity@checkstep.com and a Jira ticket must be created, giving details of the circumstances of the loss and\nthe sensitivity of the business information stored on it.\n•Upon leaving the organization, the device owner must allow the device to be audited and all business-related\ndata and applications removed.\nRevision History\nVersionDateEditorDescription of Changes\n0.110-Sep-2021Tuan LeInitial Creation\n0.214-Dec-2021Guillaume BouchardUpdated BYOD\n0.34-Jan-2022Guillaume BouchardEmployee Devices Usage\n0.48-Nov-2022Vilius PankauskasAdding responsibilities section\n0.47th Nov 2023Vilius Pankauskasno significant change\n0.418 Nov 2024Vilius Pankauskasno changes\n\nPolicy version history\nPolicy details\nPolicy name\nSystem Access Control Policy\nRenewal date\nDecember 1, 2025\nDescription\nThe System Access Control Policy defines procedures to onboard and offboard users to technical infrastructure in a manner that\nminimizes the risk of information loss or exposure.\nVersion history\nVersion 1\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 9, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 2\nExplanation of changes\nBring Your Own Device (BYOD) Requirements is added\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nDecember 7, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 3\nExplanation of changes\nBYOD policy\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nDecember 14, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\n\nVersion 4\nExplanation of changes\nOffboarding procedure is extracted and transferred to HR policy\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nDecember 15, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 5\nExplanation of changes\nAccess Removal section added\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nJanuary 4, 2022February 10, 2022Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 6\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 8, 2022November 23, 2022Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 7\nExplanation of changes\nyearly policies review\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 30, 2023November 30, 2023Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas\nVersion 8\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 18, 2024November 18, 2024Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"result\": \"Valid\",\n  \"details\": []\n}"}]}

Applicable security requirements and controls\nwill be identified through an information security risk assessment.\nDesign System Component Phase\nThe Design System Components phase transforms requirements into specifications to guide the work of the\nDevelopment phase. The decisions made in this phase address how the system will meet the functional, physical,\ninterface, data, and security requirements. Design phase activities may be conducted in an iterative fashion, producing a\nsystem design that emphasizes the functional features of the system and technical detail.\nBuild System Component Phase\nThe Build phase transforms the detailed system design into complete coded software units and eventually, into an\nintegrated product for release. Each software unit and subsequent integrated units are tested thoroughly, to include tests\nfor security vulnerabilities. System documents that support installation and operations are also developed in this phase.\nEvaluate System Readiness Phase\nThe evaluation phase ensures that the system, as designed and built, satisfies the requirements of the user, as well as\napplicable security requirements. Whenever possible, independent testers measure the system's ability to perform the\nfunctions that are required by the customer and ensure an acceptable level of quality, performance, and security. Once\nthe phase is complete, it will be evident whether or not the system is ready for operation or redevelopment.\nSystem Deployment Phase\nSystem Deployment phase is the final phase of the development life cycle, when the system is released initially to a\npilot site, where any further security vulnerabilities can be identified, and then into the production environment. All\nnecessary training for using the system is accomplished.\nProject Management\nThe sequence of the development phases depends on the software development approach taken. The project\nmanagement approaches include but are not limited to:\n•Waterfall Development\n•Agile Development\n•Iterative Development\n•Staged Delivery Development\nBased on the approach for and the size of the software development, some of the phases can be combined. In Iterative\nDevelopment there may be multiple Cycles (iterations) of the above phases before the final software is released.\nManaging Test Information\nTest data must be carefully managed to ensure it does not compromise the security, privacy, or integrity of production\nenvironments. Under no circumstances should test information, such as test accounts, data, or configurations, be\ndeployed to production environments. If test data or accounts are inadvertently introduced into production, they must\nbe promptly identified and securely removed. Testing activities should always utilize dedicated environments separate\nfrom production, and production-like security controls must be implemented in test environments to safeguard sensitive\ndata. Where the use of production data in testing is unavoidable, it must be approved by the Information Resource\nOwner, anonymized or tokenized wherever feasible, and securely deleted after testing is completed.\n\nSecure System Engineering Principles\nInformation security implications will be addressed and reviewed regularly, and responsibilities for information security\nwill be defined and allocated to the roles defined in the project management methods.\nSDLC Security Control Guidelines\nThe SDLC process will adhere to the following information security controls:\n•Adequate procedures should be established to provide separation of duties in the origination and approval of\nsource documents. This shall include but not be limited to separation of duties between Personnel assigned to\nthe development/test environment and those assigned to the production environment.\n•Modification of code or an emergency release will follow the change control standard.\n•Secure programming standards should be followed. Secure code training should be provided to Checkstep's\ndevelopers.\n•Secure development environment will be created, based on:\n◦sensitivity of data to be processed, stored and transmitted by the system;\n◦applicable external and internal requirements, e.g. from regulations or policies;\n◦security controls already implemented by the organization that support system development;\n◦trustworthiness of personnel working in the environment;\n◦the degree of outsourcing associated with system development;\n◦the need for segregation between different development environments;\n◦control of access to the development environment;\n◦monitoring of change to the environment and code stored therein;\n◦backups are stored at secure offsite locations; and,\n◦control over movement of data from and to the environment.\n•All software deployed on Corporate or Hosted infrastructure must prevent security issues including but not\nlimited to those covered by the best practices SANS and OWASP for the secure development of software.\n•Code changes are reviewed by individuals other than the originating code author and by individuals who are\nknowledgeable in code review techniques and secure coding practices.\n•Overrides of edit checks, approvals, and changes to confirmed transactions should be appropriately\nauthorized, documented, and reviewed.\n•Application development activity should be separated from the production and test environments. The extent\nof separation, logical or physical, is recommended to be appropriate to the risk of the business application or\nbe in line with customer contractual requirements. The level of separation that is necessary between\nproduction, development, and test environments should be evaluated and controls established to secure that\nseparation.\n•All changes to production environments should strictly follow change control procedures, including human\napproval of all changes, granted by an authorized owner of that environment. Automated updates should be\ndisallowed without such approval.\n•Active production environments should not be re-used as test environments. Inactive and/or decommissioned\nproduction environments should not be used as test environments unless all private data has been removed.\nTest environments should not be re-used as production environments without going through a\ndecommissioning and recommissioning process that cleans all remnants of test data, tools, etc.\n•Individuals who are responsible for supporting or writing code for an internet-facing application, or internal\napplication that utilizes web technology and handles customer information, should complete annual security\ntraining specific to secure coding practices. For individuals supporting or writing code for an internet-facing\napplication, training should also include topics specific to internet threats. The individual should complete the\ntraining prior to writing or supporting the code. The training must include OWASP secure development\nprinciples as well as OWASP top 10 vulnerability awareness for the most recent year available.\n•Custom accounts and user IDs and/or passwords should be removed from applications before applications\nbecome active or are released to customers.\n•Production data should not be used in testing or development environments.\n•Security controls that are in place for the production copy in the test system should be production quality (e.g.\nmirroring the production controls over the data).\n\nFor situations demonstrating that testing needs to use production data, the requirements are the following:\n•The Information Resource Owner will provide approval before production data can be used for testing\npurposes.\n•Wherever possible, the production data should be tokenized or anonymized instead of using production data.\n•Testing and parallel runs should use a separate copy of production data and the test location or destination\nshould be acceptable (e.g. loading confidential production data to a laptop for testing is not acceptable).\n•The data should not be extracted, handled, or used by the test process in a manner that subjects the data to\nunauthorized disclosure.\n•The data should be accessed on a need-to-know basis.\n•Normal test activities should not use production data. In cases where test activity requires access to\nproduction data, access to production data should be restricted to only those individuals who have a\ndocumented business need. Only the information with the documented business need should be accessible by\nthose users.\n•Production data used for testing should be securely erased upon completion of testing.\n•Test data and accounts will be removed before being placed into production.\n•Restricted/Protected Information will be encrypted according to the Encryption Standard while at rest or in\ntransit.\n•Error messages must be handled securely and they must not leak sensitive information.\nRevision History\nVersionDateEditorDescription of Changes\n1.17th Nov 2023Vilius PankauskasInitial Creation\n1.118 Nov 2024Vilius Pankauskasno changes\n\nPolicy version history\nPolicy details\nPolicy name\nSoftware Development Life Cycle Policy\nRenewal date\nDecember 1, 2025\nDescription\nThis policy defines the high-level requirements for providing business program managers, business project managers, technical project\nmanagers, and other program and project stakeholders guidance to support the approval, planning, and life cycle development of the\ncompany's software systems.\nVersion history\nVersion 1\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nAugust 28, 2021December 14, 2021Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 2\nExplanation of changes\nThe change management is now in Operations Security Policy\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nFebruary 2, 2022February 10, 2022Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 3\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 28, 2022November 28, 2022Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 4\n\nExplanation of changes\nyearly policies review\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 30, 2023December 1, 2023Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 5\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 18, 2024November 20, 2024Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"result\": \"Valid\",\n  \"details\": []\n}"}]}

The following procedures\nwill be enforced as applicable to Checkstep assets to ensure proper maintenance, tracking, monitoring, and handling of\nassets:\n•A detailed asset inventory will be maintained to track and monitor assets.\n◦All significant assets will be accounted for on the inventory.\n◦Items can be excluded from the inventory if they carry very low purchase/replacement costs\n(including time and labor needed to install and configure) and pose little or no risk to business\noperations or compliance status.\n•Each significant asset serial number will be associated with an employee possessing it. The assets to names\nlist will be stored in an online inventory list.\n◦Details should include a description of the type of asset, the make/model of the asset, technical\nspecifications, license details, and versions of the software packages or operating systems.\n◦Assets that contain, store, or handle information, will be classified per theData Classification\n\nPolicy.\n•All copies of media assets will be clearly marked for the attention of the authorized recipient.\n◦Temporary or permanent copies of information will be at a level consistent with the protection of the\noriginal information.\n•Access to each asset will be restricted based on the asset's classification.\n•A record of authorized recipients of assets will be established and maintained.\n•The disposal/replacement of physical and virtual assets will be tracked, whether it is due to depreciation,\nexpiring leases or agreements, obsolescence/end of support, loss, or other reasons.\n•A reporting function will support auditing and monitoring for IT compliance with this standard.\nAsset Inventory Standard\nAn asset inventory process must be in place to support the technological management of critical business processes and\nto meet legal and regulatory requirements. The inventory process will also support the discovery, management and\nreplacement/ disposal of all assets. It will further facilitate the identification and removal of any illegal or unauthorized\nsoftware, asset, or processes found in the Checkstep environment. To accomplish these goals, all physical and virtual\nassets under Checkstep management or control will be listed in an inventory that will include:\n•Unique identifier or name of the asset.\n•Description of the asset\n•Purpose of the asset and the role the asset has in supporting critical business processes and in meeting legal or\nregulatory requirements., if applicable\n•Entity responsible for the asset\n•Classification of the asset, if applicable, as prescribed in theData Classification Policy\nAsset Ownership\nCheckstep will assign an owner to each asset when the asset is created or transferred to Checkstep. The asset owner can\nbe an individual or an entity with approved management responsibility to control the whole lifecycle of the asset; the\nasset owner will not necessarily have property rights to the asset.\nThe asset owner will be responsible for the proper management of the asset over the asset's entire lifecycle, or until a\nnew owner is assigned to the asset. The asset owner will:\n•Ensure that assets are inventoried.\n•Ensure that assets are appropriately classified and protected.\n•Define and periodically review access restrictions and classification to important assets, taking into account\napplicable access control policies.\n•Ensure proper handling when the asset is deleted/destroyed.\nPhysical Asset Inventory\nCheckstep leverages a SaaS-based asset management system, Drata, to maintain inventory of all company owned\nphysical computing equipment, including but not limited to:\n\n•Servers\n•Workstations\n•Laptops\n•Printers\n•Networking equipment\nAll company-owned devices are subject to a complete data wipe if deemed necessary, such as in the case of device\ninfection or repurpose. This data wipe will be carried out by the employee to whom the device is assigned with the\nsupervision of the IT manager.\nDigital Asset Inventory\nCheckstep uses Drata's automated system to query across our cloud-based infrastructure to obtain detailed records of\nall digital assets, including but not limited to:\n•Virtual machines\n•Virtual servers\n•Virtual repositories\n•Security agents\n•Source code repositories\n•User accounts\nThe records are stored in a database system maintained by Checkstep. Records are tagged with owner/project and\nclassification when applicable. All records are kept up to date through automation via Drata.\nAsset Retirement Standard\nThe information resource owner determines when an asset no longer is needed or is obsolete and can be retired. If the\nasset to be replaced/retired supports mandatory legal and regulatory requirements of critical business processes, the\ninformation resource owner must ensure that any replacement asset can support these processes before the current asset\nis retired.\nBefore retiring/replacing any asset that retains data, data retention requirements for all data stored or managed by that\nasset must be reviewed, and a plan for complying with all applicable data retention requirements must be developed\nand executed. This is particularly important for assets that manage data subject to legal/regulatory scrutiny. Any data\nsubject to data retention requirements must be migrated to an appropriate destination and tested for appropriateness,\ncompleteness, accessibility and retrievability from the destination before the original data is deleted from the original\nasset as part of the asset retirement process.\nManagement of Media\nReturn of Assets Upon Termination\n•The termination process includes the return of all previously issued physical and electronic assets owned by\nor entrusted to Checkstep, as outlined in theEmployment Terms and Conditions, andAsset Management\nPolicy.\n•If Checkstep equipment was purchased by an employee or third party user, or personal equipment was used,\n\nall relevant information must be transferred to Checkstep and securely erased from the equipment.\n•Unauthorized copying of information by employees and contractors will be monitored and controlled during\nthe termination period.\nDisposal of Media\nThe steps for the secure disposal of media containing confidential information will be proportional to the sensitivity of\nthat information. The following guidelines will be applied accordingly:\n•Identification of items that require disposal.\n•Use of appropriate third party collection and disposal services in accordance with theVendor Management\nPolicy.\n•Secure disposal by incineration or shredding, or erasure of data for use by another application within the\ncompany.\n•Risk assessment of damaged media to determine disposal or repair.\n•Whole-disk encryption to mitigate risk of disclosure of confidential information, in line with Checkstep\nEncryption Policy.\n•Logging each disposal to maintain an audit trail.\nIntellectual Property Rights\nCheckstep takes handling and safeguarding of intellectual property very seriously. Intellectual property rights include\nsoftware or document copyright, design rights, trademarks, patents and source code licenses.\nTo ensure this the following procedures will be maintained:\n•Software will only be acquired through known and reputable sources, to ensure that copyright is not violated.\n•An asset inventory will identify all assets with requirements to protect intellectual property rights.\n•Proof and evidence of ownership of licenses, master disks, manuals, etc. will be maintained.\n•Review of the asset inventory will also make sure that only software and licensed products are installed.\n•Will ensure compliance with terms and conditions for software and information obtained from public\nnetworks\nWorkload\nSoftwareVersionLicenseResponsible\nContent ModerationAPI Service (Python)CheckstepCheckstep\nDatabasePostgresql - AWS RDSAWS\nMemcacheRedis - AWS ElasticaheAWS\nMessagingKafka - AWS MSKAWS\nIndexingElasticsearch - AWS ESAWS\n\nRevision History\nVersionDateEditorDescription of Changes\n1.025 Aug 2021Guillaume BouchardInitial Creation\n1.114 Dec 2021SagharSimplification of the policy (no more removable media)\n1.208 Nov 2022Vilius PankauskasChanged parts about inventory list and data wipe\n1.226 Oct 2023Vilius Pankauskasno changes\n1.212-Nov-2024Vilius Pankauskasno changes\n\nPolicy version history\nPolicy details\nPolicy name\nAsset Management Policy\nRenewal date\nDecember 1, 2025\nDescription\nThe Asset Management Policy defines the implementation and documentation of asset management practices, plans, processes &\nprocedures within the organization\nVersion history\nVersion 1\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nDecember 14, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 2\nExplanation of changes\nSystem Hardening Standards and Capacity Management are moved to Operations Security\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nDecember 15, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 3\nExplanation of changes\nIP rights is added\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nJanuary 5, 2022February 10, 2022Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\n\nVersion 4\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 8, 2022November 23, 2022Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 5\nExplanation of changes\nyearly policies review\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 30, 2023December 1, 2023Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 6\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 12, 2024November 20, 2024Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"result\": \"Valid\",\n  \"details\": []\n}"}]}

Records of findings must be retained for at least 2 years.\nThe scanning and identification of Checkstep's system vulnerabilities is performed by:\n•Automated Drata security agent installed on all employees' machines.\n•AWS Inspector for infrastructure and AWS ECR vulnerability scanner for images\nAdditionally, periodic security scans of Checkstep systems are done using a combination of external open-source and\ncommercial vulnerability testing tools, including but not limited to:\n•Container Analysis performs vulnerability scans on images in artifact registry\n•Secrets scanning in the code base\n•Dependency scanning automatically finds security vulnerabilities in software dependencies. For example,\nGitLab dependency scanning is interopable with Python package managers using a tool called Gemnasium.\nUser Interface applications using JavaScript can have dependencies scanned using a tool such as Retire.js\nPenetration Testing\nInternal penetration tests are done regularly as the product is being developed by Checkstep security team utilising\nautomated and manual processes. Penetration testing is performed by a certified penetration tester from an independent\nthird party at least once every two years or upon Checkstep's client request, whichever comes sooner.\nFindings from a vulnerability scan and/or penetration test are analyzed by the Security Officer, together with IT and\nEngineering as needed, and reported through the process defined in the next section.\nSecurity Findings Reporting, Tracking and Remediation\nCheckstep follows a simple vulnerability tracking process using Jira. The records of findings are retained for minimal 2\nyears.\nReporting a Finding\n•Upon identification of a vulnerability (including vulnerability in software, system, or process), a Jira ticket is\ncreated.\n•The description of the Finding should include further details, without any confidential information, and a link\nto the source.\n•The Finding will be given a priority level in Jira\nPriority/Severity Ratings and Service Level Agreements\nIn an effort to quickly remediate security vulnerabilities, the following timelines have been put in place to address\n\nPriority\nLevel\nSLADefinitionExamples\nCritical24HVulnerabilities that cause a privilege escalation on\nthe platform from unprivileged to admin, allows\nremote code execution, financial theft, unauthorized\naccess to/extraction of sensitive data, etc.\nVulnerabilities that result in Remote\nCode Execution such as Vertical\nAuthentication bypass, SSRF, XXE,\nSQL Injection, User authentication\nbypass\nHigh5\ndays\nVulnerabilities that affect the security of the platform\nincluding the processes it supports.\nLateral authentication bypass, Stored\nXSS, some CSRF depending on impact\nMediumBest\neffort\nVulnerabilities that affect multiple users, and require\nlittle or no user interaction to trigger\nReflective XSS, Direct object reference,\nURL Redirect, some CSRF depending\non impact\nLowBest\neffort\nIssues that affect singular users and require\ninteraction or significant prerequisites (MitM) to\ntrigger.\nCommon flaws, Debug information,\nMixed Content\nvulnerabilities:\nIn the case a severity rating and/or priority level is updated after a vulnerability finding was originally created, the SLA\nis updated as follow:\n•Priority upgrade: reset SLA from time of escalation\n•Priority downgrade: SLA time remains the same from time of creation/identification of finding\nResolving a Finding\n•The Finding should be assigned to the owner responsible for the system or software package.\n•All findings should be addressed according to the established SLA.\n•No software should be deployed to production with unresolved CRITICAL or HIGH findings, unless an\nException is in place (see below).\n•A finding may be resolved by\n1.providing a valid fix/mitigation\n2.determining as a false positive\n3.documenting an approved exception\nClosing a Finding\n•The assignee should provide a valid resolution (see above) and add a comment to the finding.\n•The finding should be re-assigned to the Reporter or a member of the security team for validation.\n•Upon validation, the finding can be marked as Done (closed) by the Reporter.\n•Before the finding can be marked as closed by the reporter, the fix must be deployed to a development\nenvironment and have a targeted release date for deploying to production noted on the ticket.\nExceptions\n•An Exception may be requested when a viable or direct fix to a vulnerability is not available. For example, a\nversion of the package that contains the fix is not supported on the particular operating system in use.\n•An alternative solution (a.k.a. compensating control) must be in place to address the original vulnerability\nsuch that the risk is mitigated. The compensating control may be technical or a process or a combination of\nboth.\n•An Exception must be opened in the form of a Jira ticket\n\n•The Exception Issue must reference the original Finding by adding an Issue Link to the Finding issue.\n•Each Exception must be reviewed and approved by the Security Officer and the impacted asset owner.\nRevision History\nVersionDateEditorDescription of Changes\nInitial Creation\n1.108-11-2022\nVilius\nPankauskas\nSpecifying the penetration testing schedule\n1.2\n7th Nov\n2023\nVilius\nPankauskas\nadding the secrets scanner as a part of scanners suite\n1.318 Nov 2024\nVilius\nPankauskas\nfixed the frequency of the scans (twice a year) to match the Drata\ncontrols\n\nPolicy version history\nPolicy details\nPolicy name\nVulnerability Management Policy\nRenewal date\nDecember 1, 2025\nDescription\nThe Vulnerability Management Policy outlines the company's procedures to uncover, classify, track, and remediate security\nvulnerabilities.\nVersion history\nVersion 1\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nAugust 28, 2021-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 2\nExplanation of changes\nThe penetration testing policy is changed\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nFebruary 1, 2022-Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 3\nExplanation of changes\nAdd example tools and move medium vulnerabilities to best effort\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nFebruary 15, 2022February 15, 2022Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\n\nVersion 4\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 8, 2022November 23, 2022Guillaume BouchardGuillaume Bouchard\nVersion 5\nExplanation of changes\nyearly policies review\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 30, 2023November 30, 2023Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas\nVersion 6\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 18, 2024November 18, 2024Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"result\": \"Valid\",\n  \"details\": []\n}"}]}

Access by any other entity is allowable only on a minimum\nnecessary basis. All users are responsible for reporting an incident of unauthorized use or access of the organization's\ninformation systems.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this procedure is to provide a policy and guideline for creating, modifying, or removing access to the\ncompany's network and data by creating, changing or deleting the network account configuration for a User.\nRoles and responsibilities\nThe Chief Information Security Officer is responsible for updating, reviewing, and maintaining this policy.\nScope\nThis policy and defined process is used to allow access to the company's data and systems to individuals who meet the\nrequirements defined in this policy. This policy governs individuals who are granted access that is necessary to support\nthe business. This policy relates to all data used, processed, stored, maintained, or transmitted in and through the\ncompany's systems.\nAccess Establishment and Modification\nRequests for access to Checkstep Platform systems and applications are made formally using the following process:\n\n1.A Checkstep workforce member initiates the access request by creating an Issue in the Checkstep ticketing\nsystem.\na.User identities must be verified prior to granting access to new accounts.\nb.Identity verification must be done in person where possible; for remote employees, identities must\nbe verified over the phone or through a video call.\nc.For new accounts, the method used to verify the user's identity must be recorded on the Issue.\n2.The Security Officer will grant or reject access to systems as dictated by the employee's job title. If additional\naccess is required outside of the minimum necessary to perform job functions, the requester must include a\ndescription of why the additional access is required as part of the access request.\n3.If the request is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.\n4.If the review is approved, the request is marked as \"Done\", and any pertinent notes are added.\nAccess Reviews\nAll access to Checkstep systems and services is reviewed and updated on an annual basis to ensure proper\nauthorizations are in place commensurate with job functions. The process for conducting reviews is outlined below:\n1.The Security Officer initiates the review of user access by creating an Issue in the Checkstep Ticketing\nSystem\n2.The Security Officer is assigned to review levels of access for each Checkstep workforce member.\n3.If user access is found during review that is not in line with the least privilege principle, the Security Officer\nmay modify user access and notify the user of access changes.\n4.Once the review is complete, the Security Officer then marks the ticket as \"Done\", adding any pertinent notes\nrequired.\nWorkforce Clearance\n•The level of security assigned to a user to the organization's information systems is based on the minimum\nnecessary amount of data access required to carry out legitimate job responsibilities assigned to a user's job\nclassification.\n•All access requests are treated on a\"least-access and need-to-know principles.\"\n•Checkstep maintains a minimum necessary approach to access to Customer data.\nUnique User Identification\n•Access to the Checkstep Platform systems and applications is controlled by requiring unique User Login IDs\nand passwords for each individual user and developer.\n•Passwords requirements mandate strong password controls.\n•Passwords are not displayed at any time and are not transmitted or stored in plain text.\n•Default accounts on all production systems, including root, are disabled.\n•Shared accounts are not allowed within Checkstep systems or networks.\n•Automated log-on configurations other than the company's approved Password Management provider that\nstore user passwords or bypass password entry are not permitted for use with Checkstep workstations or\nproduction systems.\nAutomatic Logoff\n•Users are required to make information systems inaccessible by any other individual when unattended by the\nusers (ex. by using a password protected screen saver or logging off the system).\n\nAccess Removal\n•All user IDs that have been inactive for thirty (30) days will be revoked unless specifically authorized by the\ncompany leadership.\n•In response to feedback from management, systems administrators must promptly revoke all privileges no\nlonger needed by users.\nEmployee Devices Usage\nDevices include workstations and mobile devices items such as laptops, notebooks, tablet devices, smartphones and\nsmart watches.\nThe workstations/laptops or other mobile device that at Checkstep are either company owned, or owned by the\nemployee following the BYOD requirement below. An organization-provided device must be used primarily for\nCheckstep-related business purposes and shall be protected.\n•Mobile endpoint devices must meet the requirements for use as stated in theAcceptable Use PolicyandAsset\nManagement Policy.\n•Classified information:The storage, transmission and processing of Checkstep classified information should\nbe primarily done on mobile devices provided by the organization. If not possible, personal device can be\nused if specifically authorized by Checkstep security services,and the BYOD Requirements below have been\nfulfilled.\n•Physical integrity:precautions to protect all mobile devices and computer media must be taken. For example,\nusers should not leave a laptop unattended or on display in a car such that it would encourage an opportunist\ntheft.\n•No peripheral:Checkstep does not provide to its employees any storage media or peripherals. Ask approval\nfrom Checkstep IT services or Security Officer if adding or using personal peripheral hardware to store and\ntransport business related information is required.\n•Encryption: The device will be secured so that all of the data on it is encrypted and so is only accessible if the\npassword is known. If the device is supplied with encryption, do not disable it.\n•Firewalls: Devices must have firewalls enabled to prevent unauthorized network access unless an exemption\nhas been granted by Checkstep security services.\n•Malware protection:Personal or company-provided device will be protected by organization-supplied anti-\nmalware software. Attempting to disable anti-malware protection constitute of breach of this Policy.\n•Adding malware/viruses: It is a breach of company Policy to introduce viruses or other malware into the\nsystem or network, for example by inserting unknown peripherals or media into a device containing company\ninformation.\n•If browser add-ons are approved and installed, a browser testing tool shall be run to ensure the security of the\nadd-on.\n•Stolen mobile devices must immediately be reported to the Security Officer using email or by creating a ticket\nin Jira.\nBring Your Own Device (BYOD) Requirements\nBYOD is the concept of employees using their personally owned device for work purposes.

facilities, infrastructure, and sensitive data based on a risk-\nbased approach and implemented where feasible. \nAccess Restriction: Physical access to the company's secure facilities, such as server rooms and critical infrastructure, is restricted to \nauthorized personnel only. In remote locations, employees are responsible for securing access to company resources through digital \nmeans, such as VPNs and secure login systems.\nEmployee Identification: In secure controlled facilities, employees are required to wear identification badges to distinguish themselves \nas authorized personnel. In remote environments, this control may not be applicable but should be supplemented by other identity \nverification methods where necessary.\nVisitor Management: Visitors and vendors must be escorted by an authorized employee at all times while on company premises. Visitor \naccess may not be applicable in remote locations, but employees are required to ensure the confidentiality and security of any sensitive \ninformation.\nIncident Reporting: All workforce members are responsible for reporting unauthorized visitors or access attempts to company facilities \nor systems. This includes both physical locations and remote work environments. Reporting should be immediate to the Security Officer \nor Facility Manager.\nRecord-Keeping: It is recommended to retain a detailed record of each physical access, including visits, maintenance, and repairs \nwhere feasible.\nGiven the remote nature of many locations, physical controls will be implemented flexibly based on an assessment of the risks involved in \neach environment.\n3.2 Access Requirements\nPhysical access to secure facilities is managed through badge readers, smart locks, and physical keys. In environments where these \ncontrols are not applicable, such as coworking spaces, alternative security measures based on risk assessments will be applied.\nBadge and Key Management: Access to the company's badge and key systems is restricted to authorized personnel based on a need-\nto-know basis. Workforce members must report lost or stolen keys or badges immediately to their manager, and the Facility Manager \nmust re-provision access or change locks within 7 days.\nRestricted Areas: Secure areas, such as server rooms, must be locked when unattended, and access is granted only to authorized \nemployees. In remote or coworking environments, employees must ensure their devices and sensitive information are secured.\nVisitor Controls: Visitors must sign a log upon entering secure facilities, indicating the date, time, purpose, and point of contact. Visitor \nlogs must be kept for at least 3 months. In remote environments, visitor controls may not be applicable but should be replaced by strong \ndigital access controls.\nLoading and Delivery Areas: Access to loading and delivery areas is restricted to authorized personnel, and shipments should be \ninspected according to Asset Management procedures. In remote locations, this control may not be necessary but should be considered \nif the location handles sensitive assets.\n3.3 Maintenance and Monitoring\nContinuous monitoring and maintenance of physical security systems are crucial for protecting the company's assets. These requirements \napply primarily to formal company locations, while remote work environments may not require such stringent controls.\nMany of the company's operations take place either in its own offices or remotely, including at home, in cafes, or coworking spaces. \nThe company's own offices may also be considered as remote locations in certain contexts.\nAs a result, certain physical security controls, such as badge systems or visitor logs, may not be applicable to all environments. \nSecurity measures will be applied based on a risk-based approach and implemented where feasible. The specific controls \nimplemented will vary depending on the location and the nature of the activities being conducted there.\n\nMaintenance of Security Equipment: Any repairs or maintenance to physical security equipment, including locks, cameras, and access \ncontrol systems, must be documented, with records retained for at least seven years.\nCCTV Monitoring: Secure areas must be monitored by CCTV, with recordings stored for at least 3 months.

All \naccess is regulated using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), adhering to the Principle of Least Privilege to ensure that each user has \nonly the necessary access required to perform their duties.\nMinimum Necessary Access: User access to systems is determined by job classification, ensuring that only the minimum necessary \nlevel of access is granted.\nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC): The assignment of user rights and access to systems is regulated by the RBAC method, \nensuring that access levels align with user roles and responsibilities.\nSegregation of Duties: The need for segregation of duties is considered when assigning user rights, preventing potential conflicts of \ninterest or undue concentration of authority.\nFormal Documentation and Authorization: All access requests, including the addition, deletion, and modification of user IDs, \nauthentication factors, and other identifying objects, must be documented and formally authorized.\nAccess Request Process: Workforce members initiate access requests by creating an issue in the company's ticketing system, \ndetailing the type of access needed.\nIdentity Verification: User identities must be verified in person whenever possible before granting access to new accounts. For remote \nemployees, verification may be conducted over the phone, with the method of verification recorded in the ticketing system.\nAuthorization by Security Officer: The Security Officer is responsible for granting or rejecting access based on the employee's role \nand job classification. If additional access is required, the requester must provide a valid reason as part of the request.\nReview and Documentation: If an access request is rejected, it must go through a further review process, with detailed documentation. \nApproved requests are marked as complete and include all pertinent notes.\nAccess to the company's systems is carefully regulated through RBAC, ensuring that users are granted only the minimum necessary access \nfor their roles. Formal documentation and identity verification are required, with reviews conducted for additional access requests to \nmaintain security and accountability.\n3.2 Access Reviews\nUser access to company systems and services will be subject to periodic reviews to ensure that accounts, including third-party or vendor \naccounts, are appropriately assigned based on job functions. These reviews help maintain compliance with the Principle of Least Privilege \nand ensure access rights are adjusted as needed.\nQuarterly Access Reviews: Management will conduct formal access reviews at least once every quarter to verify that the roles and \npermissions associated with all user accounts, including third-party or vendor accounts, are still appropriate.\nJob Function Alignment: Access reviews focus on ensuring that user roles and permissions are aligned with current job functions and \nthat no excess or unauthorized access exists.\nManagement Authorization: During the access review, management is responsible for confirming that user accounts are in compliance \nwith established authorization requirements.\nQuarterly access reviews ensure that user accounts, including third-party and vendor accounts, remain aligned with job responsibilities, \npreventing unnecessary or unauthorized access to sensitive systems. These reviews are a key part of the company's efforts to maintain \nappropriate security controls.\n3.3 User Identification and Authentication\nTo ensure the security of system components, users and administrators must be authenticated using at least one authentication factor. This \nprocess is critical to safeguarding the company's systems and sensitive information.\nAuthentication Factors: Access will require at least one of the following:\nSomething you know, such as a password or passphrase.\n\nSomething you have, such as a token device or smart card.\nSomething you are, such as a biometric element.\nUnique Login Credentials: Each user will have a unique login ID and password, ensuring individual accountability.\nAuthentication Requirements: Single sign-on (SSO) and minimum password requirements will be enforced based on the company's \nPassword Policy. Passwords will never be displayed, transmitted, or stored in plain text.\nDefault Accounts: Default accounts on all production systems, including root, will be deleted, disabled, or restricted to a limited number \nof authorized administrators. These accounts will only be used under exceptional circumstances with documented business justification \nand management approval.\nShared Accounts: The use of group, shared, or generic accounts is prohibited unless absolutely necessary and approved by \nmanagement. Individual user identity must be confirmed before access is granted, and all actions must be traceable to a specific user.\nAuthentication Tokens: Physical or logical tokens, smart cards, or certificates will be assigned to individual users and cannot be \nshared. Additional controls, such as PINs or biometric data, will ensure only authorized users can access accounts.\nAutomated Log-on: Automated log-on configurations, other than the company's approved password management tools, are prohibited \nfrom storing user passwords or bypassing password entry on workstations or production systems.\nThe company enforces strict identification and authentication policies, requiring the use of unique credentials, secure authentication factors, \nand limiting access to default and shared accounts. These measures ensure accountability and safeguard access to critical systems.\n3.4 Multi-factor Authentication\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all system access where technically feasible, providing an additional layer of security for \nusers, administrators, and third parties.\nUse of MFA: MFA will be enforced to enhance security by requiring multiple types of authentication for access to systems.\nSystem Configuration: Systems using MFA must:\nPrevent replay attacks through secure token generation and validation processes.\nRequire at least two distinct types of authentication factors (e.g., something you know, something you have, or something you are).\nRestrict any bypassing of MFA by users, including administrative users, unless specifically documented and approved by \nmanagement on an exception basis, for a limited time period.\nRemote Access: MFA is mandatory for all remote access to the company's network, including access by users, administrators, and \nthird-party vendors. This ensures that remote connections are secure and access is only granted to authenticated users.\nMulti-factor authentication is essential to securing system access, particularly for remote access scenarios. By requiring multiple \nauthentication factors and preventing unauthorized bypassing, the company maintains a high level of security for all users and systems.\n3.5 Automated Logoffs\nAutomated logoffs are implemented to secure devices and systems by minimizing unauthorized access due to inactivity.\nScreen Lock Timeout: Company-issued devices and any bring-your-own or third-party devices connected to company systems will \nenforce a screensaver lock with a timeout of 15 minutes or less of inactivity. This ensures that devices are locked when not actively in \nuse, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\nSystem Logoff: Where technically feasible, the company's applications and systems will automatically log users out after 15 minutes of \ninactivity or upon closure of the system or internet browser. This configuration secures the system by terminating sessions that may \notherwise remain vulnerable to unauthorized access.\nAutomated logoffs are an important control for ensuring security, by locking or logging out inactive sessions on both devices and systems. \nThese measures protect sensitive data by ensuring that unattended devices and open sessions are quickly secured.\n\n3.6 Third-Party Access\nThird-party access to the company's systems is strictly controlled to ensure security and accountability when external entities access critical \nsystem components.\nTime-Limited Access: Accounts provided to third parties for system access, support, or maintenance will be enabled only for the \nrequired time period. Access will be granted based on documented approval from management and will be promptly disabled once the \nspecific task is completed.\nMonitoring of Remote Access: All third-party remote access will be continuously monitored by company personnel for any signs of \nunauthorized or unexpected activity. Monitoring will include real-time oversight and logging of access events to ensure accountability and \ndetect potential security risks.\nAuthorization and Documentation: All third-party access must be authorized by management, with clear documentation outlining the \npurpose, duration, and scope of access. No third-party access will be granted without proper authorization.\nThird-party access is restricted and closely monitored to ensure that external entities are granted system access only when necessary, with \nappropriate safeguards in place to detect and address any unauthorized activity.\n3.7 Application and System Accounts\nApplication and system accounts will be managed to ensure access is limited to only what is necessary for system operability and will follow \nstrict guidelines for security.\nProvisioning of Accounts: All application and system accounts will be provisioned based on documented authorization from \nmanagement. Access privileges will be limited to only what is necessary for the application or system to function effectively, \nminimizing unnecessary access.\nInteractive Login Management: \nPrevention of Interactive Use: Interactive login through system or application accounts will be prevented unless specifically \nrequired for an exceptional circumstance. \nTime-Limited Access: If interactive access is required, it will be restricted to the necessary timeframe to complete the required \ntask. \nBusiness Justification: A documented business justification must accompany any request for interactive login, explaining why \nsuch access is necessary.\nManagement Approval: Interactive use must be explicitly approved by management, ensuring that only authorized personnel can \nuse the account.\nAccountability: Every action taken using an interactive account must be attributable to an individual user. Individual user identity \nwill be confirmed before access is granted.\nApplication and system accounts will be tightly controlled to ensure that they are only used for necessary system operations, with interactive \naccess limited to exceptional circumstances and approved by management. Every action must be linked to an identifiable user to maintain \naccountability.\n3.8 Use of Utility Programs\nAccess to utility programs that have the potential to bypass normal operating system or application controls will be restricted to authorized \npersonnel to maintain the security and integrity of the company's systems.\nRestricted Access to Utility Programs: Only authorized system administrators will have access to manage utility programs such as \nanti-virus consoles, diagnostic tools, patching software, backup utilities, and network tools. These programs will be restricted from \ngeneral user access due to their ability to bypass normal security controls.\nPrivileged Utility Access Control: \nStandard User Restrictions: Standard users will be restricted from accessing privileged utilities or making modifications to their \nconfigurations.\n\nAuthentication and Access Controls: Strict authentication mechanisms and access controls will be implemented to ensure only \nauthorized administrators can access or modify utility programs, preventing unauthorized changes to the system.\nUtility programs with the ability to bypass security controls will be strictly restricted to authorized system administrators, with standard users \ndenied access. This ensures the integrity of system configurations and limits unauthorized access to privileged tools.\n3.9 Employee Termination/Offboarding Procedures\nThe company will revoke system and physical access for terminated users (employees, third parties, vendors, and other personnel) \npromptly to safeguard its systems and data.\nAccess Revocation: System and physical access will be revoked within one business day of the termination date. This applies to all \nterminated users including employees, vendors, and third parties.\nTermination Checklist and Notification:\nThe HR/People department, along with the users and their supervisors, are responsible for notifying system administrators of \nupcoming separations and ensuring the completion of a \"Termination Checklist.\"\nSystem administrators will terminate access rights within the established service level agreements (SLAs) upon notification of \ntermination or separation.\nAsset Return Tracking: \nThe HR/People department (or designated department) will track the return of all electronic and physical assets, including \nlaptops, files, access mechanisms (such as keys, access cards, badges, and multi-factor authentication tokens) as part of the \noffboarding process.\nIncident-Based Access Termination:\nSystem administrators will terminate a user's access if there is evidence or suspicion that:\nThe user has been misusing their access rights.\nA user's password has been compromised. If the user is not responsible for the password compromise, a new password may \nbe provided.\nUpon termination, the company ensures that access to systems and physical locations is revoked within one business day, while the \nHR/People department oversees asset returns and the completion of termination procedures. Access is also terminated if there is misuse or \nevidence of a password compromise.\n3.10 Disabling Accounts: High-Risk Users\nThe company will disable accounts of users deemed to pose a high risk to its systems and data. Accounts will be disabled for a specified \nperiod depending on the risk severity.\nUser intends to sell company information to a competitor Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser accesses unauthorized sensitive data without a business \nneed \nImmediately                 3 weeks                     \nUser deliberately attempts to bypass security controls Immediately                 6 weeks                     \nUser leaks confidential information to external parties Immediately                 2 months                    \nUser violates policy by sharing credentials Immediately                 2 weeks                     \nUser installs unauthorized software or malware Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser repeatedly fails to comply with security procedures Immediately                 4 weeks                     \nUser uses company resources for illegal activities Immediately                 Permanent Disablement       \nRiskTime Period to DisableDuration of Disablement\n\nHigh-risk accounts will be disabled promptly based on the nature of the risk and the severity of the violation.

Suspensions that are \nrecommended as part of the normal progression of this progressive discipline policy and procedure are subject to approval from a next-\nlevel manager and HR.\n3.11.4 Step 4: Recommendation for Termination of Employment\nDescription: The last step in the progressive discipline procedure is a recommendation to terminate employment. Generally, the \ncompany will try to exercise the progressive nature of this policy by first providing warnings, a final written warning or suspension from \nthe workplace before proceeding to a recommendation to terminate employment. However, the company reserves the right to combine \nand skip steps depending on the circumstances of each situation and the nature of the offense. Furthermore, employees may be \nterminated without prior notice or disciplinary action.\nApproval Process: Management's recommendation to terminate employment must be approved by HR and the supervisor's immediate \nmanager. Final approval may be required from the CEO.\n3.11.5 Performance and Conduct Issues Not Subject to Progressive Discipline\nBehavior that is illegal is not subject to progressive discipline, and such behavior may be reported to local law enforcement authorities. \nTheft, substance abuse, intoxication, fighting, and other acts of violence at work are grounds for immediate termination.\n\n3.11.6 Enforcement\nAuthority: The company's management, under the explicit authority granted by the company CEO, retains the authority and \nresponsibility to monitor and enforce compliance with this policy and other policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines.

This process is consistent with the company's cultural values, \nHuman Resources (HR) best practices, and employment laws.\nThe company reserves the right to combine or skip steps depending on the facts of each situation and the nature of the offense. The level of \ndisciplinary intervention may vary based on factors such as whether the offense is repeated despite coaching, counseling, or training, the \nemployee's work record, and the impact the conduct and performance issues have on the organization.\n3.11.1 Step 1: Verbal Warning and Counseling\nDescription: This initial step creates an opportunity for the immediate supervisor to schedule a meeting with an employee to bring \nattention to an existing performance, conduct, or attendance issue. The supervisor should discuss with the employee the nature of the \nproblem or the violation of company policies and procedures. The supervisor is expected to clearly describe expectations and the steps \nthe employee must take to improve performance or resolve the problem.\n3.11.2 Step 2: Formal Written Warning\nDescription: If the employee does not promptly correct any performance, conduct, or attendance issues that were identified in Step 1, a \nwritten warning will become formal documentation of the performance, conduct, or attendance issues and consequences. The employee \nwill sign a copy of the document to acknowledge receipt and understanding of the formal warning. During Step 2, the immediate \nsupervisor and HR representative will meet with the employee to review any additional incidents or information about the performance, \nconduct, or attendance issues as well as any prior relevant corrective action plans. Management will outline the consequences for the \nemployee of his or her continued failure to meet performance or conduct expectations.\nPerformance Improvement Plan (PIP): A formal performance improvement plan (PIP) requiring the employee's immediate and \nsustained corrective action will be issued after a Step 2 meeting. A warning outlining that the employee may be subject to additional \ndiscipline up to and including termination if immediate and sustained corrective action is not taken may also be included in the written \nwarning.\n3.11.3 Step 3: Suspension and Final Written Warning\nDescription: There may be performance, conduct, or safety incidents so problematic and harmful that the most effective action may be \nthe temporary removal of the employee from the workplace. When immediate action is necessary to ensure the safety of the employee \nor others, the immediate supervisor may suspend the employee pending the results of an investigation. Suspensions that are \nrecommended as part of the normal progression of this progressive discipline policy and procedure are subject to approval from a next-\nlevel manager and HR.\n3.11.4 Step 4: Recommendation for Termination of Employment\nDescription: The last step in the progressive discipline procedure is a recommendation to terminate employment. Generally, the \ncompany will try to exercise the progressive nature of this policy by first providing warnings, a final written warning or suspension from \nthe workplace before proceeding to a recommendation to terminate employment. However, the company reserves the right to combine \nand skip steps depending on the circumstances of each situation and the nature of the offense. Furthermore, employees may be \nterminated without prior notice or disciplinary action.\nApproval Process: Management's recommendation to terminate employment must be approved by HR and the supervisor's immediate \nmanager. Final approval may be required from the CEO.\n3.11.5 Performance and Conduct Issues Not Subject to Progressive Discipline\nBehavior that is illegal is not subject to progressive discipline, and such behavior may be reported to local law enforcement authorities. \nTheft, substance abuse, intoxication, fighting, and other acts of violence at work are grounds for immediate termination.\n\n3.11.6 Enforcement\nAuthority: The company's management, under the explicit authority granted by the company CEO, retains the authority and \nresponsibility to monitor and enforce compliance with this policy and other policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines. Monitoring \nactivities may be conducted on an ongoing basis or on a random basis whenever deemed necessary by management and may require \ninvestigating the use of the company's information resources.

The periodic security awareness training will be supplemented with multiple methods of\ncommunicating awareness and educating personnel as deemed necessary by management, such as newsletters, web-\nbased training, in-person training, periodic phishing simulations, etc.\nThe organization will properly communicate to its workforce and, if appropriate, contractors:\n•Security updates, changes, and incidents, as needed, via email or appropriate Slack channels.\n•Reminders for security responsibilities as part of the annual security awareness training.\nIn addition, consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities, incident response and contingency training to personnel\nwill be provided:\n•Within 90 days of assuming an incident response role or responsibility;\n•As required by information system or policy changes; and/or\n•Annually\nIntellectual Property Rights\nAkirolabs takes handling and safeguarding of intellectual property very seriously. Intellectual property rights include\nsoftware or document copyright, design rights, trademarks, patents and source code licenses.\n\nTo ensure this the following procedures will be maintained:\n•Software will only be acquired through known and reputable sources, to ensure that copyright is not violated.\n•An asset inventory will identify all assets with requirements to protect intellectual property rights.\n•Proof and evidence of ownership of licenses, master disks, manuals, etc. will be maintained.\n•Review of the asset inventory will also make sure that only software and licensed products are installed.\n•Will ensure compliance with terms and conditions for software and information obtained from public\nnetworks\nInformation Security Requirements Analysis & Specifications\nAkirolabs will identify its information security requirements through utilizing different methods, ensure the results of\nthe identification are documented and reviewed by all stakeholders, and will integrate the requirements and associated\nprocesses in early stages of projects.\nMethods\n•Policies and regulations\n•Threat modeling\n•Incident reviews\n•Use of vulnerability thresholds\nFactors\n•Level of confidence required towards the claimed identity of users, in order to derive user authentication\nrequirements.\n•Access provisioning and authorization processes, for business and privileged or technical users.\n•Informing users and operators of their duties and responsibilities.\n•Protection needs of assets, especially in terms of availability, confidentiality, integrity.\n•Business processes (e.g., transaction logging and monitoring, non-repudiation requirements).\n•Other security controls (e.g. interfaces to logging and monitoring or data leakage detection systems).\nEmployment Terms and Conditions\nThe following terms and conditions of employment at Akirolabs are the contractual obligations for employees or\ncontractors for the safeguarding of information.They include, but are not limited to:\n•Signing a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement (NDA) prior to access to confidential information and\nprocessing facilities.\n•Legal responsibilities and rights, particularly concerning intellectual property.\n•Responsibilities for the classification of information and management of organizational assets associated with\ninformation, information processing facilities and information services handled by an employee or contractor.\n•Responsibilities for handling of information received from third parties.\n•Reviewing and agreeing with the security policies of the company.\n•Duration of responsibilities beyond end of employment.\n•Actions to be taken for non-compliance with the terms and conditions, and the company's security policies.\nDisciplinary Process\nAkirolabs's discipline policy and procedures are designed to provide a structured corrective action process to improve\nand prevent a recurrence of undesirable employee behavior and performance issues. It has been designed to be\nconsistent with Akirolabs cultural values, Human Resources (HR) best practices, and employment laws.\n\nAkirolabs reserves the right to combine or skip steps depending on the facts of each situation and the nature of the\noffense. The level of disciplinary intervention may also vary. Some of the factors that will be considered are whether\nthe offense is repeated despite coaching, counseling, or training, the employee's work record, and the impact the\nconduct and performance issues have on the organization.\nStep 1: Verbal Warning and Counseling\nThis initial step creates an opportunity for the immediate supervisor to schedule a meeting with an employee to bring\nattention to an existing performance, conduct or attendance issue. The supervisor should discuss with the employee the\nnature of the problem or the violation of company policies and procedures. The supervisor is expected to clearly\ndescribe expectations and the steps the employee must take to improve performance or resolve the problem.\nStep 2: Formal Written Warning\nIf the employee does not promptly correct any performance, conduct or attendance issues that were identified in Step 1,\na written warning will become formal documentation of the performance, conduct, or attendance issues and\nconsequences. The employee will sign a copy of the document to acknowledge receipt and understanding of the formal\nwarning. During Step 2, the immediate supervisor and HR representative will meet with the employee to review any\nadditional incidents or information about the performance, conduct or attendance issues as well as any prior relevant\ncorrective action plans. Management will outline the consequences for the employee of his or her continued failure to\nmeet performance or conduct expectations.\nA formal performance improvement plan (PIP) requiring the employee's immediate and sustained corrective action will\nbe issued after a Step 2 meeting. A warning outlining that the employee may be subject to additional discipline up to\nand including termination if immediate and sustained corrective action is not taken may also be included in the written\nwarning.\nStep 3: Suspension and Final Written Warning\nThere may be performance, conduct, or safety incidents so problematic and harmful that the most effective action may\nbe the temporary removal of the employee from the workplace. When immediate action is necessary to ensure the\nsafety of the employee or others, the immediate supervisor may suspend the employee pending the results of an\ninvestigation. Suspensions that are recommended as part of the normal progression of this progressive discipline policy\nand procedure are subject to approval from a next-level manager and HR.\nStep 4: Recommendation for Termination of Employment\nThe last step in the progressive discipline procedure is a recommendation to terminate employment. Generally,\nAkirolabs will try to exercise the progressive nature of this policy by first providing warnings, a final written warning\nor suspension from the workplace before proceeding to a recommendation to terminate employment. However,\nAkirolabs reserves the right to combine and skip steps depending on the circumstances of each situation and the nature\nof the offense. Furthermore, employees may be terminated without prior notice or disciplinary action.\nManagement's recommendation to terminate employment must be approved by HR and the supervisor's immediate\nmanager. Final approval may be required from the CEO.\nPerformance and Conduct Issues Not Subject to Progressive Discipline\nBehavior that is illegal is not subject to progressive discipline, and such behavior may be reported to local law\nenforcement authorities. Theft, substance abuse, intoxication, fighting and other acts of violence at work are grounds\nfor immediate termination.\nEnforcement\nAkirolabs Management, under the explicit authority granted by the company CEO, retains the authority and\nresponsibility to monitor and enforce compliance with this Policy and other policies, standards, procedures, and\nguidelines. Monitoring activities may be conducted on an on-going basis or on a random basis whenever deemed\n\nnecessary by Management and may require investigating the use of the Company's information resources. The\ncompany reserves the right to review any and all communications and activities without notice.\nAkirolabs will take appropriate precautions to ensure that monitoring activities are limited to the extent necessary to\ndetermine whether the communications or activities are in violation of Company policies, standards, procedures, and\nguidelines or in accordance with normal business processing performance or quality activities.\nViolation of the controls established in this Policy is prohibited and will be appropriately addressed. Disciplinary\nactions for violations may include verbal and/or written warnings, suspension, termination, and/or other legal remedies\nand will be consistent with our published HR standards and practices.\n\nRevision History\nVersionDateEditorApproverDescription of ChangesFormat\n104/08/24RhymetecUche\nAkajiuba\nInitial policy reviewDigital\n\nPolicy version history\nPolicy details\nPolicy name\nInformation Security Policy\nRenewal date\nApril 8, 2025\nDescription\nThe Information Security Policy is a set of rules, policies and procedures designed to ensure all users and networks within the company\nmeet minimum IT security and data protection security requirements.\nVersion history\nVersion 1\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nJune 6, 2024June 6, 2024Uche AkajiubaUche Akajiuba"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"result\": \"Valid\",\n  \"details\": []\n}"}]}

This document also provides implementing\ninstructions for security incident response, including definitions, procedures, responsibilities, and performance\nmeasures (metrics and reporting mechanisms).\nScope\nThis policy applies to all users of information systems within Asolvi AS. This typically includes employees and\ncontractors, as well as any external parties that come into contact with systems and information controlled by Asolvi\nAS(hereinafter referred to as \"users\"). This policy must be made readily available to all users.\nBackground\nA key objective of Asolvi AS's Information Security Program is to focus on detecting information security weaknesses\nand vulnerabilities so that incidents and breaches can be prevented wherever possible. Asolvi AS is committed to\nprotecting its employees, customers, and partners from illegal or damaging actions taken by others, either knowingly or\nunknowingly. Despite this, incidents and data breaches are likely to happen; when they do, Asolvi AS is committed to\nrapidly responding to them, which may include identifying, containing, investigating, resolving, and communicating\ninformation related to the breach.\nThis policy requires that all users report any perceived or actual information security vulnerability or incident as soon\nas possible using the contact mechanisms prescribed in this document. In addition, Asolvi AS must employ automated\nscanning and reporting mechanisms that can be used to identify possible information security vulnerabilities and\nincidents. If a vulnerability is identified, it must be resolved within a set period based on its severity. If an incident is\nidentified, it must be investigated within a set period based on its severity. If an incident is confirmed as a breach, a set\nprocedure must be followed to contain, investigate, resolve, and communicate information to employees, customers,\npartners, and other stakeholders.\nWithin this document, the following definitions apply:\n•Information Security Vulnerability:\nA vulnerability in an information system, information system security procedures, or administrative controls\nthat could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to information or to disrupt critical processing.\n•Information Security Incident:\nA suspected, attempted, successful, or imminent threat of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, breach,\nmodification, or destruction of information; interference with information technology operations; or\nsignificant violation of information security policy.\n•Information Security Event\nAn occurrence or change in the normal behavior of systems, networks, or services that may impact security\nand organizational operations (e.g., possible compromise of policies or failure of controls).\nRoles and Responsibilities\nThe IT Director is responsible for the maintenance and updating of this policy\n\nPolicy\n•All users must report any system vulnerability, incident, or event pointing to a possible incident to the\nSecurity Manager as quickly as possible but no later than 24 hours.\n•Incidents must be reported by sending an email message with details of the incident.\n•Users must be trained on the procedures for reporting information security incidents or discovered\nvulnerabilities, and their responsibilities to report such incidents. Failure to report information security\nincidents shall be considered to be a security violation and will be reported to the Human Resources (HR)\nManager for disciplinary action.\n•Information and artifacts associated with security incidents (including but not limited to files, logs, and screen\ncaptures) must be preserved appropriately if they need to be used as evidence of a crime.\n•All information security incidents must be responded to through the incident management procedures defined\nbelow.\nPeriodic Evaluation\nIt is important to note that the processes surrounding security incident response should be periodically reviewed and\nevaluated for effectiveness. This also involves appropriate training of resources expected to respond to security\nincidents, as well as the training of the general population regarding Asolvi AS's expectations for them, relative to\nsecurity responsibilities. The incident response plan is tested annually.\nProcedure For Establishing Incident Response System\n•Define on-call schedules and assign an Information Security Manager (ISM) responsible for managing\nincident response procedures during each availability window.\n•Define a notification channel to alert the on-call ISM of a potential security incident. Establish a company\nresource that includes up-to-date contact information for on-call ISM.\n•Assign management sponsors from the Engineering, Legal, HR, Marketing, and C-Suite teams.\n•Distribute procedures for Executing Incident Response to all staff and ensure up-to-date versions are\naccessible in a dedicated company resource.\n•Require all staff to complete training for Procedure For Executing Incident Response at least once per year.\nReporting Incidents\nThe following situations are to be considered for information security event reporting:\n•Ineffective security control;\n•Breach of information integrity, confidentiality, or availability expectations;\n•Human errors;\n•Non-compliance with policies or guidelines;\n•Breaches of physical security arrangements;\n•Uncontrolled system changes;\n•Malfunctions of software or hardware;\n•Access violations; and,\n•Malfunctions or other anomalous system behavior is indicative of a security attack or actual security breach.\nReporting Incidents - Cloud Service\n(For Cloud Service Customers) Asolvi AS will acquire information from cloud service providers about the procedures\nfor:\n•Reporting a detected information security incident to the cloud service provider;\n•Cloud service providers receiving reports concerning a detected information security incident;\n\n•Monitoring the status of a reported information security incident.\nAgreements between Asolvi AS and cloud service providers will outline the processes for responding to requests for\npotential digital evidence or other information from within the cloud computing environment.\n(For Cloud Service Providers) Asolvi AS will establish mechanisms for:\n•It's cloud service customers to report an information security;\n•Asolvi AS to report an information security incident to its cloud service customers;\n•Its cloud service customers to track the progress of a reported information security incident.\nAgreements between Asolvi AS and its cloud service customers will outline the processes for responding to requests\nfor potential digital evidence or other information from within the cloud computing environment.\nProcedure For Executing Incident Response\nRefer to our Asolvi Major Incident Process on Sharepoint\nhttps://evatic365.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/MajorIncident/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B027D2A3C-\nCF24-4EFB-9985-9E17A4583FAE%7D&file=Major-Incident-Process-\nv-1.2.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true\n\nAPPENDIX A:\nSecurity Incident Report Template\n1.0 Reported by\n1.1 Last Name:\n1.2 First Name:\n1.3 Position:\n1.4 Company/Org Name:\n1.5 Telephone No:\n1.6 E-mail:\n2.0 Organization Details\n2.1 Name of organization:\n2.2 Type of organization:\n2.3 Street Address:\n2.4 At this time, is it known that other organizations are affected by this incident?

The privileges granted to users must be\nreevaluated by management annually. In response to feedback from management, systems administrators must\npromptly revoke all privileges no longer needed by users.\nTeleworking\nRequirements\n•Secure remote access must be strictly controlled with encryption and strong pass-phrases. Refer to the\nEncryption Policyand thePassword Policyfor further information.\n•Authorized Users must protect their login and password, without exception.\n•While using an Asolvi AS-owned computer to remotely connect to the company's network, authorized users\nmust ensure the remote host is not connected to any other network at the same time, except personal networks\nthat are under their complete control or under the complete control of an authorized user or third party.\n•The most up-to-date antivirus software must be used on all computers.

This is crucial as installing commercially licensed software in a cloud service may inadvertently\nbreach the terms of the software license. This procedure will give particular attention to scenarios where the cloud\nservice features are elastic and scalable, which may result in the software being used on more systems or processor\ncores than is permitted by the license terms.\nCloud Service Providers\nAsolvi AS will have an established process for responding to intellectual property rights complaints, ensuring the\nprotection of proprietary assets.\nInformation Security Requirements Analysis & Specifications\nAsolvi AS will identify its information security requirements by utilizing different methods, ensure the results of the\nidentification are documented and reviewed by all stakeholders, and will integrate the requirements and associated\nprocesses in the early stages of projects.\nMethods\n•Policies and regulations\n•Threat modeling\n•Incident reviews\n•Use of vulnerability thresholds\n\nFactors\n•Level of confidence required towards the claimed identity of users, to derive user authentication requirements.\n•Access provisioning and authorization processes, for business and privileged or technical users.\n•Informing users and operators of their duties and responsibilities.\n•Protection needs of assets, especially in terms of availability, confidentiality, and integrity.\n•Business processes (e.g., transaction logging and monitoring, non-repudiation requirements).\n•Other security controls (e.g. interfaces to logging and monitoring or data leakage detection systems).\nEmployment Terms and Conditions\nThe following terms and conditions of employment at Asolvi AS are the contractual obligations for employees or\ncontractors for the safeguarding of information. They include, but are not limited to:\n•Signing a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement (NDA) before access to confidential information and\nprocessing facilities.\n•Legal responsibilities and rights, particularly concerning intellectual property.\n•Responsibilities for the classification of information and management of organizational assets associated with\ninformation, information processing facilities, and information services handled by an employee or contractor.\n•Responsibilities for the handling of information received from third parties.\n•Reviewing and agreeing with the security policies of the company.\n•Duration of responsibilities beyond the end of employment.\n•Actions to be taken for non-compliance with the terms and conditions, and the company's security policies.\nDisciplinary Process\nAsolvi AS's discipline policy and procedures are designed to provide a structured corrective action process to improve\nand prevent a recurrence of undesirable employee behavior and performance issues. It has been designed to be\nconsistent with Asolvi AS cultural values, Human Resources (HR) best practices, and employment laws.\nAsolvi AS reserves the right to combine or skip steps depending on the facts of each situation and the nature of the\noffense. The level of disciplinary intervention may also vary. Some of the factors that will be considered are whether\nthe offense is repeated despite coaching, counseling, or training, the employee's work record, and the impact the\nconduct and performance issues have on the organization.\nStep 1: Verbal Warning and Counseling\nThis initial step creates an opportunity for the immediate supervisor to schedule a meeting with an employee to bring\nattention to an existing performance, conduct, or attendance issue. The supervisor should discuss with the employee the\nnature of the problem or the violation of company policies and procedures. The supervisor is expected to clearly\ndescribe expectations and the steps the employee must take to improve performance or resolve the problem.\nStep 2: Formal Written Warning\nIf the employee does not promptly correct any performance, conduct or attendance issues that were identified in Step 1,\na written warning will become formal documentation of the performance, conduct, or attendance issues and\nconsequences. The employee will sign a copy of the document to acknowledge receipt and understanding of the formal\nwarning. During Step 2, the immediate supervisor and HR representative will meet with the employee to review any\nadditional incidents or information about the performance, conduct, or attendance issues as well as any prior relevant\ncorrective action plans. Management will outline the consequences for the employee of his or her continued failure to\nmeet performance or conduct expectations.\nA formal performance improvement plan (PIP) requiring the employee's immediate and sustained corrective action will\nbe issued after a Step 2 meeting. A warning outlining that the employee may be subject to additional discipline up to\nand including termination if immediate and sustained corrective action is not taken may also be included in the written\n\nwarning.\nStep 3: Suspension and Final Written Warning\nThere may be performance, conduct, or safety incidents so problematic and harmful that the most effective action may\nbe the temporary removal of the employee from the workplace. When immediate action is necessary to ensure the\nsafety of the employee or others, the immediate supervisor may suspend the employee pending the results of an\ninvestigation. Suspensions that are recommended as part of the normal progression of this progressive discipline policy\nand procedure are subject to approval from a next-level manager and HR.\nStep 4: Recommendation for Termination of Employment\nThe last step in the progressive discipline procedure is a recommendation to terminate employment. Generally, Asolvi\nAS will try to exercise the progressive nature of this policy by first providing warnings, a final written warning or\nsuspension from the workplace before proceeding to a recommendation to terminate employment. However, Asolvi As\nreserves the right to combine and skip steps depending on the circumstances of each situation and the nature of the\noffense. Furthermore, employees may be terminated without prior notice or disciplinary action.\nManagement's recommendation to terminate employment must be approved by HR and the supervisor's immediate\nmanager. Final approval may be required from the CEO.\nPerformance and Conduct Issues Not Subject to Progressive Discipline\nIllegal behavior is not subject to progressive discipline, and such behavior may be reported to local law enforcement\nauthorities. Theft, substance abuse, intoxication, fighting, and other acts of violence at work are grounds for immediate\ntermination.\nEnforcement\nAsolvi AS Management, under the explicit authority granted by the company CEO, retains the authority and\nresponsibility to monitor and enforce compliance with this Policy and other policies, standards, procedures, and\nguidelines. Monitoring activities may be conducted on an ongoing basis or on a random basis whenever deemed\nnecessary by Management and may require investigating the use of the Company's information resources. The\ncompany reserves the right to review all communications and activities without notice.\nAsolvi AS will take appropriate precautions to ensure that monitoring activities are limited to the extent necessary to\ndetermine whether the communications or activities violate Company policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines or\nper normal business processing performance or quality activities.\nViolation of the controls established in this Policy is prohibited and will be appropriately addressed. Disciplinary\nactions for violations may include verbal and/or written warnings, suspension, termination, and/or other legal remedies\nand will be consistent with our published HR standards and practices.\nCloud Computing\nCustomers\nAsolvi AS will take the following into account for information security in cloud computing:\n•Information stored in its cloud computing environment may be accessed and managed by cloud service\nproviders.\n•Assets, such as application programs, could be maintained within the cloud computing environment.\n•Processes may run on multi-tenant, virtualized cloud service platforms.\n•The specific context of cloud service users and the circumstances surrounding the usage of the cloud service.\n•Administrators who have privileged access to the cloud service.\n•Geographical locations of the cloud service provider's organization and where customer data might be stored,\neven temporarily.\n\nCloud Service Providers\nAsolvi AS will address the provision and use of its cloud services, taking the following into account:\n•Baseline information security requirements during the design and implementation of cloud services.\n•Mitigation of risks associated with authorized insiders.\n•Multi-tenancy and cloud service customer isolation, including robust virtualization measures.\n•Access controls for staff accessing its cloud service customer assets, including strong authentication\nmechanisms.\n•Effective communication channels with its cloud service customers during change management processes.\n•Deployment of robust virtualization security measures.\n•Access control for the protection of cloud service customer data.\n•Lifecycle management of cloud service customer accounts.\n•Communication of security breaches to cloud service customers and providing guidelines and support for\ninvestigations and forensics to ensure effective incident response and remediation.\nRevision History\nVersionDateEditorApproverDescription of Changes\n1.023/11/2023Anmol KandrooMathew MakinInitial Creation and first review\n1.0113/09/2024\nAdedoyin\nJokomba\nMathew MakinChanged ownership\n2.016/09/2024\nAdedoyin\nJokomba\nMathew MakinAdded revision history\n\nPolicy version history\nPolicy details\nPolicy name\nInformation Security Policy\nRenewal date\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDescription\nThe Information Security Policy is a set of rules, policies and procedures designed to ensure all users and networks within the company\nmeet minimum IT security and data protection security requirements.\nVersion history\nVersion 1\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 22, 2023December 21, 2023Mathew MakinMathew Makin\nVersion 2\nExplanation of changes\nAdded revision history\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nSeptember 17, 2024-Mathew MakinMathew Makin\nVersion 3\nExplanation of changes\nUpdated version history and reviewed policy\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nSeptember 17, 2024September 19, 2024Mathew MakinMathew Makin"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"result\": \"Valid\",\n  \"details\": []\n}"}]}

It has been designed to be\nconsistent with Asolvi AS cultural values, Human Resources (HR) best practices, and employment laws.\nAsolvi AS reserves the right to combine or skip steps depending on the facts of each situation and the nature of the\noffense. The level of disciplinary intervention may also vary. Some of the factors that will be considered are whether\nthe offense is repeated despite coaching, counseling, or training, the employee's work record, and the impact the\nconduct and performance issues have on the organization.\nStep 1: Verbal Warning and Counseling\nThis initial step creates an opportunity for the immediate supervisor to schedule a meeting with an employee to bring\nattention to an existing performance, conduct, or attendance issue. The supervisor should discuss with the employee the\nnature of the problem or the violation of company policies and procedures. The supervisor is expected to clearly\ndescribe expectations and the steps the employee must take to improve performance or resolve the problem.\nStep 2: Formal Written Warning\nIf the employee does not promptly correct any performance, conduct or attendance issues that were identified in Step 1,\na written warning will become formal documentation of the performance, conduct, or attendance issues and\nconsequences. The employee will sign a copy of the document to acknowledge receipt and understanding of the formal\nwarning. During Step 2, the immediate supervisor and HR representative will meet with the employee to review any\nadditional incidents or information about the performance, conduct, or attendance issues as well as any prior relevant\ncorrective action plans. Management will outline the consequences for the employee of his or her continued failure to\nmeet performance or conduct expectations.\nA formal performance improvement plan (PIP) requiring the employee's immediate and sustained corrective action will\nbe issued after a Step 2 meeting. A warning outlining that the employee may be subject to additional discipline up to\nand including termination if immediate and sustained corrective action is not taken may also be included in the written\n\nwarning.\nStep 3: Suspension and Final Written Warning\nThere may be performance, conduct, or safety incidents so problematic and harmful that the most effective action may\nbe the temporary removal of the employee from the workplace. When immediate action is necessary to ensure the\nsafety of the employee or others, the immediate supervisor may suspend the employee pending the results of an\ninvestigation. Suspensions that are recommended as part of the normal progression of this progressive discipline policy\nand procedure are subject to approval from a next-level manager and HR.\nStep 4: Recommendation for Termination of Employment\nThe last step in the progressive discipline procedure is a recommendation to terminate employment. Generally, Asolvi\nAS will try to exercise the progressive nature of this policy by first providing warnings, a final written warning or\nsuspension from the workplace before proceeding to a recommendation to terminate employment. However, Asolvi As\nreserves the right to combine and skip steps depending on the circumstances of each situation and the nature of the\noffense. Furthermore, employees may be terminated without prior notice or disciplinary action.\nManagement's recommendation to terminate employment must be approved by HR and the supervisor's immediate\nmanager. Final approval may be required from the CEO.\nPerformance and Conduct Issues Not Subject to Progressive Discipline\nIllegal behavior is not subject to progressive discipline, and such behavior may be reported to local law enforcement\nauthorities. Theft, substance abuse, intoxication, fighting, and other acts of violence at work are grounds for immediate\ntermination.\nEnforcement\nAsolvi AS Management, under the explicit authority granted by the company CEO, retains the authority and\nresponsibility to monitor and enforce compliance with this Policy and other policies, standards, procedures, and\nguidelines. Monitoring activities may be conducted on an ongoing basis or on a random basis whenever deemed\nnecessary by Management and may require investigating the use of the Company's information resources. The\ncompany reserves the right to review all communications and activities without notice.\nAsolvi AS will take appropriate precautions to ensure that monitoring activities are limited to the extent necessary to\ndetermine whether the communications or activities violate Company policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines or\nper normal business processing performance or quality activities.\nViolation of the controls established in this Policy is prohibited and will be appropriately addressed. Disciplinary\nactions for violations may include verbal and/or written warnings, suspension, termination, and/or other legal remedies\nand will be consistent with our published HR standards and practices.\nCloud Computing\nCustomers\nAsolvi AS will take the following into account for information security in cloud computing:\n•Information stored in its cloud computing environment may be accessed and managed by cloud service\nproviders.\n•Assets, such as application programs, could be maintained within the cloud computing environment.\n•Processes may run on multi-tenant, virtualized cloud service platforms.\n•The specific context of cloud service users and the circumstances surrounding the usage of the cloud service.\n•Administrators who have privileged access to the cloud service.\n•Geographical locations of the cloud service provider's organization and where customer data might be stored,\neven temporarily.\n\nCloud Service Providers\nAsolvi AS will address the provision and use of its cloud services, taking the following into account:\n•Baseline information security requirements during the design and implementation of cloud services.\n•Mitigation of risks associated with authorized insiders.\n•Multi-tenancy and cloud service customer isolation, including robust virtualization measures.\n•Access controls for staff accessing its cloud service customer assets, including strong authentication\nmechanisms.\n•Effective communication channels with its cloud service customers during change management processes.\n•Deployment of robust virtualization security measures.\n•Access control for the protection of cloud service customer data.\n•Lifecycle management of cloud service customer accounts.\n•Communication of security breaches to cloud service customers and providing guidelines and support for\ninvestigations and forensics to ensure effective incident response and remediation.\nRevision History\nVersionDateEditorApproverDescription of Changes\n1.023/11/2023Anmol KandrooMathew MakinInitial Creation and first review\n1.0113/09/2024\nAdedoyin\nJokomba\nMathew MakinChanged ownership\n2.016/09/2024\nAdedoyin\nJokomba\nMathew MakinAdded revision history\n\nPolicy version history\nPolicy details\nPolicy name\nInformation Security Policy\nRenewal date\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDescription\nThe Information Security Policy is a set of rules, policies and procedures designed to ensure all users and networks within the company\nmeet minimum IT security and data protection security requirements.\nVersion history\nVersion 1\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nNovember 22, 2023December 21, 2023Mathew MakinMathew Makin\nVersion 2\nExplanation of changes\nAdded revision history\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nSeptember 17, 2024-Mathew MakinMathew Makin\nVersion 3\nExplanation of changes\nUpdated version history and reviewed policy\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\nSeptember 17, 2024September 19, 2024Mathew MakinMathew Makin"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"result\": \"Valid\",\n  \"details\": []\n}"}]}

The RIS will conduct a preliminary investigation \nto determine the scope and severity.\nContainment: Immediate actions must be taken to contain the incident, including isolating affected systems and limiting access.\nInvestigation: The RIS, with relevant teams, will gather and analyze evidence, determine the root cause, and assess the impact on \nsystems, data, and operations.\nCommunication: If required, the incident must be communicated to customers, partners, and stakeholders by coordinating with the legal \nand communications teams.\nThe structured response process ensures that the company can efficiently contain and investigate incidents while minimizing operational \ndowntime.\n3.4 Evidence Collection and Preservation\nThe company must ensure that all actions during an incident are documented and evidence is preserved for further analysis and \ninvestigation.\nHigh           Catastrophic incidents that disrupt operations or violate legal \nrequirements                                    \nImmediate escalation to CISO, RIS, and \nexecutive team; notification to external \nauthorities may be required                 \nMedium         Incidents that impact one or more business units, causing \ndelays or moderate damage to business operations      \nIncident management and containment \nwith input from business unit heads and \nRIS; communication to affected parties \nrequired \nLow            Minor incidents that violate company plan but have limited \noperational impact                                \nManaged internally by RIS and relevant \nteams, documentation, and resolution \nwithin standard operating procedures            \nSeverity LevelDefinitionResponse\nSystem Logs               Capture logs from affected systems, preserve them for analysis and potential legal proceedings               \nFiles and Data            Collect copies of files involved in the incident, storing them securely for further investigation            \nScreen Captures           Take screenshots of suspicious activity or anomalies to document unauthorized access or system \ncompromise    \nNetwork Traffic           Preserve network logs and capture details of any suspicious traffic to aid in forensic analysis              \nType of EvidenceRequired Actions\n\nPreserving evidence is critical to understanding the full extent of an incident and ensuring regulatory compliance.\n3.5 Post-Incident Analysis and Reporting\nOnce the incident has been resolved, a post-incident analysis must be conducted to identify lessons learned and prevent recurrence.\nRoot cause analysis: Determine the primary cause of the incident, including any control failures or plan violations.\nDocumentation of lessons learned: Record any improvements to security controls, processes, or employee training that could prevent \nsimilar incidents.\nReporting: The RIS must prepare an incident report, which includes severity, cause, actions taken, and any external disclosures made \nduring the incident.\nPost-incident analysis allows the company to continuously improve its security posture by learning from past incidents.\n3.6 Incident Communication and Escalation\nClear communication is essential during an incident to ensure that all affected parties are informed and the appropriate teams are mobilized.\nInternal communication: Notify key stakeholders, including the CISO, CIO, and business unit heads, about the incident and its severity.\nExternal communication: If necessary, communicate with customers, partners, or regulatory bodies regarding the incident, following \nlegal and compliance guidelines.\nEscalation: Incidents deemed high or critical must be escalated to executive leadership, and external authorities may be contacted if \nthere is a legal requirement or threat to sensitive data.\nEffective communication ensures that all parties are aware of the incident and appropriate response measures are taken.\n3.7 Security Incident Report Template\nThe Security Incident Report Template is designed to provide a structured framework for documenting and reporting security incidents in \na clear, consistent, and comprehensive manner. It ensures that all relevant details of a security incident are captured, allowing for thorough \ninvestigation, response, and mitigation. The template facilitates communication between all stakeholders involved in incident management, \nincluding internal teams, external partners, and regulatory authorities.\nThe template is organized into hierarchical sections to ensure clarity and ease of use. Each section focuses on specific aspects of the \nincident, such as:\n1. Reported by: Collects information on the person reporting the incident, including their contact details and organization.\n2. Organization Details: Captures details about the affected organization and any other organizations impacted.\n3. Incident Details Including Injury and Impact Level: Provides a detailed account of the incident, including the time, location, system, \ndata compromise, and the classification level of the information affected.\n4. Status of Mitigation Actions: Documents the steps taken to mitigate the incident and any additional assistance required.\n5. Computer Network Defense Incident Type: Records the type of incident, such as malicious code, service disruption, or unauthorized \naccess.\n6. Systems Affected: Logs details about the network zones, system types, operating systems, and protocols affected by the incident.\n7. Post Incident Activities: Ensures that any necessary notifications have been made to authorities and that a root cause analysis has \nbeen conducted to prevent future occurrences.\nEach field provides a description to clarify the type of information required, making the template comprehensive yet easy to follow. The goal \nis to ensure that all critical aspects of an incident are properly documented for effective management, response, and future prevention.\nReported by                    \n

This data requires the highest level of protection due to its potential impact on the company \nand its customers if disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization.\nInternal Data: All data owned or licensed by the company. This data is intended for use within the organization and must be protected \nfrom unauthorized access, but it does not carry the same level of risk as Confidential/Restricted Data.\nPublic Information: Any information that is available within the public domain. This data has no existing local, national, or international \nlegal restrictions on access or usage and poses minimal risk to the company if disclosed or altered.\n\nThese definitions ensure a common understanding of data types and their respective sensitivity levels, which is crucial for implementing \nappropriate security measures and maintaining compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.\n3.1.2 Working Instructions\nThis working instruction is based on the guideline on the organization's assets and the classification scheme described therein.\nClassification Specification: The owner (editor) of the information should specify appropriate classification at the time of its creation.\nLabeling Responsibility: The author is responsible for the correct labeling of information.\nPeriodic Review: Where applicable, the owner should check periodically whether the information is still needed, and the classification is \nstill justified.\nAdoption of Existing Classifications: If an item of information has already been classified by another entity or a specific classification \nis required contractually, that classification must be adopted.\nPrinted Information Marking: Printed classified information shall be marked accordingly. The classification note \"internal use\" or \n\"confidential\" shall be placed on the title page and/or in the footer of the document.\nElectronic Information Tagging: Electronic information and data should be tagged with the available metadata.\nDevice Labeling: In order to keep the administrative effort within manageable limits, the devices carrying data are not labeled. \nEmployees are instructed to treat such devices and mobile devices as if they contained classified information.\nAccess Control: Access to information categorized as \"confidential\" is given on a \"need-to-know\" basis, i.e., an individual only receives \naccess to such information to the extent necessary for the performance of his or her work. Information categorized as \"internal use\" \nshould be available to employees by default.\nPrivileged Users: Classified information is only made available to privileged users. In the case of electronically stored information, \nappropriate authorizations must be assigned.\nSecurity of Devices: Devices carrying data and devices on which classified information is stored shall be kept securely locked or \npassword protected (e.g., employee laptops should not be locked, but should be password protected).\nData Deletion: If classified information on data carriers and devices is to be deleted, it should be done in line Asset Management Poli\ncy | 3.13 Disposal of Media and Devices and lead to the permanent destruction of such information.\nDefault Classification: Documents without a label should by default be treated as \"Internal Use\" unless they are marketing or sales \nmaterials or materials intended to be available publicly or for selected external parties (which should be verified with the document \nowner).\nThese generic requirements ensure that information is classified, labeled, reviewed, and protected appropriately, maintaining the security \nand integrity of the company's data throughout its lifecycle.\n3.2 Data Classification Scheme\nData classification, in the context of information security, is the classification of data based on its level of sensitivity and the impact to the \ncompany should that data be disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization. The classification of data helps determine what baseline \nsecurity controls are appropriate for safeguarding that data. All data should be classified into one of the following classifications:\n3.2.1 Confidential/Restricted Data\nData should be classified as Confidential/Restricted when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data could cause a \nserious or significant level of risk to the company or its customers. Examples of sensitive data include data protected by state or federal \nprivacy regulations (e.g., PHI & PII) and data protected by confidentiality agreements. The highest level of security controls should be \napplied to Confidential/Restricted Data:\nAccess Restrictions: Disclosure or access to Confidential/Restricted data is limited to specific use by individuals with a legitimate need-\nto-know. Explicit authorization by the CISO is required for access due to legal, contractual, privacy, or other constraints.\nProtection Measures: Must be protected to prevent loss, theft, unauthorized access, and/or unauthorized disclosure.\nData Destruction: Must be destroyed when no longer needed. Destruction must be in accordance with company policies and \nprocedures.\n\nIncident Response: Will require specific methodologies, procedures, and reporting requirements for the response and handling of \nincidents.\n3.2.2 Internal Use Data\nData should be classified as Internal Use when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data could result in a moderate \nlevel of risk to the company or its customers. This includes proprietary, ethical, or privacy considerations. Data must be protected from \nunauthorized access, modification, transmission, storage, or other use. This applies even though there may not be a civil statute requiring \nthis protection. Internal Use Data is restricted to personnel who have a legitimate reason to access it. By default, all data that is not explicitly \nclassified as Confidential/Restricted or Public data should be treated as Internal Use data. A reasonable level of security controls should be \napplied to Internal Use Data.\n3.2.3 Public Data\nData should be classified as Public when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data would result in little or no risk to \nthe company and its customers. It is further defined as information with no existing local, national, or international legal restrictions on \naccess or usage. While little or no controls are required to protect the confidentiality of Public data, some level of control is required to \nprevent unauthorized alteration or destruction of Public Data.\n3.2.4 De-identified Data\nThe company will de-identify data as a tool to remove personal information from data that it collects, uses, archives, and shares with other \norganizations. The de-identification process will allow the removal of direct identifiers, including all unique identifying numbers, \ncharacteristics, or codes. If a data set contains any amount or type of personal information, it will not be considered de-identified.\nThis data classification scheme ensures that all data handled by the company is appropriately classified based on its sensitivity and \npotential impact. By assigning one of the defined classifications, the company can implement suitable security controls to protect the data, \nthereby maintaining data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n3.3 Assessing Classification Level and Labeling\nThe goal of information security, as stated in the Information Security Policy, is to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of \nCorporate and Customer Data. Data classification reflects the level of impact to the company if confidentiality, integrity, or availability is \ncompromised.\n3.3.1 Classification Guidance\nIf a classification is not inherently obvious, consider each security objective using the following table as a guide. All data will be assigned one \nof the following four sensitivity levels:\n4 - \nRESTRICTE\nD (Critical)\nHighly \nsensitive \ninformation.\nDictated \nexternally by legal \nand/or contractual \nrequirements.\nMust be limited to \nonly authorized \nemployees, \ncontractors, and \nbusiness partners \nwith a specific \nbusiness need.\nSeriousImpact could \ninclude negatively \naffecting the \ncompany's \ncompetitive \nposition, violating \nregulatory \nrequirements, \ndamaging the \ncompany's \nPHI, sensitive PII, \nconfidential \nagreements\nClassificati\non\nDescriptionProtectionAccessDamageImpactExamples\n\nLegend:\nClassification: The level of sensitivity assigned to the data.\nDescription: An overview of the type of information and its sensitivity.\nProtection: The required level of protection based on legal, contractual, or internal policies.\nAccess: Who is allowed to access the data and under what conditions.\nDamage: The level of damage which would occur information were to become available to unauthorized parties.\nImpact: The potential consequences if the data were to be disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization.\nExamples: Typical examples of data that fall under each classification level.\n3.3.2 Labeling\nData must be labeled according to its classification to ensure proper handling. Labels should be clear and indicate the level of sensitivity. For \nexample:\nRestricted: \"CONFIDENTIAL/RESTRICTED\"\nConfidential: \"CONFIDENTIAL\"\nInternal Use: \"INTERNAL USE ONLY\"\nPublic: No specific label required\nreputation, violating \ncontractual \nrequirements, and \nposing an identity \ntheft risk.\n3 - \nCONFIDENT\nIAL (High)\nSensitive \ninformation.\nDictated internally \nby the company.\nMust be limited to \nonly authorized \nemployees, \ncontractors, and \nbusiness partners \nwith a specific \nbusiness need.\nSignificantImpact could \ninclude negatively \naffecting the \ncompany's \ncompetitive \nposition, damaging \nthe company's \nreputation, violating \ncontractual \nrequirements, and \nexposing the \ngeographic location \nof individuals.\nInternal memos, \nproprietary \nbusiness \ninformation, \ngeneral PII\n2 - \nINTERNAL \nUSE \n(Medium)\nNon-sensitive \ninformation.\nOriginating within \nor owned by the \ncompany, or \nentrusted to it by \nothers.\nMay be shared \nwith authorized \nemployees, \ncontractors, and \nbusiness partners \nwho have a \nbusiness need.\nModerateImpact could \ninclude damaging \nthe company's \nreputation and \nviolating contractual \nrequirements.\nInternal emails, \nproject documents\n1 - PUBLIC \n(Low)\nInformation \nthat has been \napproved for \nrelease to the \ngeneral public.\nFreely shareable \nboth internally and \nexternally.\nNo specific access \nrestrictions.\nNo damageImpact would not be \ndamaging or a risk \nto business \noperations.\nPress releases, \nmarketing \nmaterials\n\n3.3.3 Cloud Computing Environment\nWhen maintaining information and associated assets in the cloud computing environment, the cloud service customer is expected to label \nthese assets following the company's defined procedures for labeling. This may include the utilization of labeling functionalities provided by \nthe cloud service provider, where relevant. The cloud service provider is obliged to document and reveal any service functionality it offers, \nenabling the company to classify and label their information and associated assets.\nProper classification and labeling are crucial for maintaining the security of data. By categorizing data based on its sensitivity and applying \nappropriate labels, the company can ensure that data is handled correctly and securely, both within the organization and in cloud \nenvironments. This process helps protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of corporate and customer data.\n3.4 Handling Controls\nThe following handling controls are designed to ensure that data is protected according to its classification level. These controls outline the \nspecific requirements for various methods of data transmission, storage, and access to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability \nof the company's information. Each classification level requires different controls to address the potential impact of unauthorized access or \ndisclosure.\n4 - \nRESTRICTE\nD (Critical)\nRequired \nprior to \naccess by \nnon-\ncompany \nemployees \nEncryption \nRequired\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited \nEncryption \nRequired\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited\nRemote Access if \nNecessary (only \nwith VPN and \ntwo-factor \nauthorization \nwhen possible) \nEncryption \nRequired\nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nUse)\nPhysical \nAccess \nRestricted to \nSpecific \nIndividuals \nEncryption \nRequired\nRemote Wipe \nEnablement \nRequired, if \npossible \nEncryption \nRequired\nDo Not \nForward \nMark \"Open by \nAddressee \nOnly\"\nUse Courier or \n\"Certified Mail\" \nand Sealed, \nTamper-\nResistant \nEnvelopes for \nExternal \nMailings \n3 - \nCONFIDEN\nTIAL (High)\nRequired \nprior to \naccess by \nnon-\ncompany \nemployees \nEncryption \nRecommende\nd\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited \nEncryption \nRequired\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited\nRemote Access if \nNecessary (only \nEncryption \nRecommended\nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nUse)\nPhysical \nAccess \nRestricted to \nSpecific groups \nEncryption \nRequired\nRemote Wipe \nEnablement \nRequired, if \npossible \nEncryption \nRequired\nDo not \nForward \nMark \"Open by \nAddressee \nOnly\"\nUse \"Certified \nMail\" and \nSealed, \nTamper-\nResistant \nEnvelopes for \nExternal \nMailings \nClassificati\non / \nHandling \nControls\nNon-\nDisclosur\ne \nAgreemen\nt (NDA)\nInternal \nNetwork \nTransmissio\nn\nExternal \nNetwork \nTransmission\nData at RestMobile \nDevices\nEmailPhysical Mail\n\nLegend:\nClassification: The level of sensitivity assigned to the data.\nHandling Controls: Specifies the required security measures for handling data at different classification levels.\nNon-Disclosure Agreement (NDA): Indicates whether an NDA is required before granting access.\nInternal Network Transmission: Requirements for transmitting data over internal networks (wired & wireless).\nExternal Network Transmission: Requirements for transmitting data over external networks (wired & wireless).\nData at Rest: Requirements for storing data on file servers, databases, archives, etc.\nMobile Devices: Requirements for handling data on mobile devices (iPhone, iPad, USB Drive, etc.).\nEmail: Requirements for sending data via email (with and without attachments).\nPhysical Mail: Requirements for sending data via physical mail.\nwith VPN and \ntwo-factor \nauthorization \nwhen possible)\n2 - \nINTERNAL \nUSE \n(Medium)\nNot \nRequired \nNo \nRequirements \nEncryption \nRecommended\nInstant \nMessaging \nAllowed \n(Corporate Only)\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited \nEncryption \nRecommended\nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nUse)\nPhysical \nAccess \nRestricted to \nSpecific groups \nEncryption \nRecommended\nRemote Wipe \nEnablement \nRecommended\n, if possible \nExercising due \ncare\nNo \nRequirements \n1 - PUBLIC \n(Low)\nNot \nRequired \nNo \nRequirements \nNo special \nrequirements \nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nModification \nOnly)\nPhysical \nAccess \nUnrestricted \n(Unauthorized \nModification \nControls \nrecommended)\nNo \nRequirements \nNo \nRequirements \nUS Mail or \nOther Public \nDelivery \nSystems \n4 - \nRESTRICTE\nD (Critical)\nMay only be \naccessible to \nauthorized \npersons.\nExercisin\ng due \ncare\nForbiddenForbiddenOnly with the \nconsent of the \nauthor.\nExercising \ndue care\nPrinting must \nbe personally \nsupervised to \nprevent \nData carriers \nmust be \nhanded over \nto the IT \nClassificati\non / \nHandling \nControls\nPaperPhoneConversati\nons\nFaxChangeCopyPrintDestroy\n\nLegend:\nPaper: Requirements for storing and handling physical paper documents.\nPhone: Requirements for exchanging information over the phone.\nConversations: Guidelines for discussing information in public areas.\nFax: Requirements for sending information via fax.\nChange: Guidelines for changing information.\nCopy: Guidelines for copying information.\nPrint: Guidelines for printing information.\nDestroy: Guidelines for destroying information.\n3.5 Integrity\nIntegrity refers to ensuring the correctness (integrity) of data and the correct functioning of systems.

All \naccess is regulated using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), adhering to the Principle of Least Privilege to ensure that each user has \nonly the necessary access required to perform their duties.\nMinimum Necessary Access: User access to systems is determined by job classification, ensuring that only the minimum necessary \nlevel of access is granted.\nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC): The assignment of user rights and access to systems is regulated by the RBAC method, \nensuring that access levels align with user roles and responsibilities.\nSegregation of Duties: The need for segregation of duties is considered when assigning user rights, preventing potential conflicts of \ninterest or undue concentration of authority.\nFormal Documentation and Authorization: All access requests, including the addition, deletion, and modification of user IDs, \nauthentication factors, and other identifying objects, must be documented and formally authorized.\nAccess Request Process: Workforce members initiate access requests by creating an issue in the company's ticketing system, \ndetailing the type of access needed.\nIdentity Verification: User identities must be verified in person whenever possible before granting access to new accounts. For remote \nemployees, verification may be conducted over the phone, with the method of verification recorded in the ticketing system.\nAuthorization by Security Officer: The Security Officer is responsible for granting or rejecting access based on the employee's role \nand job classification. If additional access is required, the requester must provide a valid reason as part of the request.\nReview and Documentation: If an access request is rejected, it must go through a further review process, with detailed documentation. \nApproved requests are marked as complete and include all pertinent notes.\nAccess to the company's systems is carefully regulated through RBAC, ensuring that users are granted only the minimum necessary access \nfor their roles. Formal documentation and identity verification are required, with reviews conducted for additional access requests to \nmaintain security and accountability.\n3.2 Access Reviews\nUser access to company systems and services will be subject to periodic reviews to ensure that accounts, including third-party or vendor \naccounts, are appropriately assigned based on job functions. These reviews help maintain compliance with the Principle of Least Privilege \nand ensure access rights are adjusted as needed.\nQuarterly Access Reviews: Management will conduct formal access reviews at least once every quarter to verify that the roles and \npermissions associated with all user accounts, including third-party or vendor accounts, are still appropriate.\nJob Function Alignment: Access reviews focus on ensuring that user roles and permissions are aligned with current job functions and \nthat no excess or unauthorized access exists.\nManagement Authorization: During the access review, management is responsible for confirming that user accounts are in compliance \nwith established authorization requirements.\nQuarterly access reviews ensure that user accounts, including third-party and vendor accounts, remain aligned with job responsibilities, \npreventing unnecessary or unauthorized access to sensitive systems. These reviews are a key part of the company's efforts to maintain \nappropriate security controls.\n3.3 User Identification and Authentication\nTo ensure the security of system components, users and administrators must be authenticated using at least one authentication factor. This \nprocess is critical to safeguarding the company's systems and sensitive information.\nAuthentication Factors: Access will require at least one of the following:\nSomething you know, such as a password or passphrase.\n\nSomething you have, such as a token device or smart card.\nSomething you are, such as a biometric element.\nUnique Login Credentials: Each user will have a unique login ID and password, ensuring individual accountability.\nAuthentication Requirements: Single sign-on (SSO) and minimum password requirements will be enforced based on the company's \nPassword Policy. Passwords will never be displayed, transmitted, or stored in plain text.\nDefault Accounts: Default accounts on all production systems, including root, will be deleted, disabled, or restricted to a limited number \nof authorized administrators. These accounts will only be used under exceptional circumstances with documented business justification \nand management approval.\nShared Accounts: The use of group, shared, or generic accounts is prohibited unless absolutely necessary and approved by \nmanagement. Individual user identity must be confirmed before access is granted, and all actions must be traceable to a specific user.\nAuthentication Tokens: Physical or logical tokens, smart cards, or certificates will be assigned to individual users and cannot be \nshared. Additional controls, such as PINs or biometric data, will ensure only authorized users can access accounts.\nAutomated Log-on: Automated log-on configurations, other than the company's approved password management tools, are prohibited \nfrom storing user passwords or bypassing password entry on workstations or production systems.\nThe company enforces strict identification and authentication policies, requiring the use of unique credentials, secure authentication factors, \nand limiting access to default and shared accounts. These measures ensure accountability and safeguard access to critical systems.\n3.4 Multi-factor Authentication\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all system access where technically feasible, providing an additional layer of security for \nusers, administrators, and third parties.\nUse of MFA: MFA will be enforced to enhance security by requiring multiple types of authentication for access to systems.\nSystem Configuration: Systems using MFA must:\nPrevent replay attacks through secure token generation and validation processes.\nRequire at least two distinct types of authentication factors (e.g., something you know, something you have, or something you are).\nRestrict any bypassing of MFA by users, including administrative users, unless specifically documented and approved by \nmanagement on an exception basis, for a limited time period.\nRemote Access: MFA is mandatory for all remote access to the company's network, including access by users, administrators, and \nthird-party vendors. This ensures that remote connections are secure and access is only granted to authenticated users.\nMulti-factor authentication is essential to securing system access, particularly for remote access scenarios. By requiring multiple \nauthentication factors and preventing unauthorized bypassing, the company maintains a high level of security for all users and systems.\n3.5 Automated Logoffs\nAutomated logoffs are implemented to secure devices and systems by minimizing unauthorized access due to inactivity.\nScreen Lock Timeout: Company-issued devices and any bring-your-own or third-party devices connected to company systems will \nenforce a screensaver lock with a timeout of 15 minutes or less of inactivity. This ensures that devices are locked when not actively in \nuse, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\nSystem Logoff: Where technically feasible, the company's applications and systems will automatically log users out after 15 minutes of \ninactivity or upon closure of the system or internet browser. This configuration secures the system by terminating sessions that may \notherwise remain vulnerable to unauthorized access.\nAutomated logoffs are an important control for ensuring security, by locking or logging out inactive sessions on both devices and systems. \nThese measures protect sensitive data by ensuring that unattended devices and open sessions are quickly secured.\n\n3.6 Third-Party Access\nThird-party access to the company's systems is strictly controlled to ensure security and accountability when external entities access critical \nsystem components.\nTime-Limited Access: Accounts provided to third parties for system access, support, or maintenance will be enabled only for the \nrequired time period. Access will be granted based on documented approval from management and will be promptly disabled once the \nspecific task is completed.\nMonitoring of Remote Access: All third-party remote access will be continuously monitored by company personnel for any signs of \nunauthorized or unexpected activity. Monitoring will include real-time oversight and logging of access events to ensure accountability and \ndetect potential security risks.\nAuthorization and Documentation: All third-party access must be authorized by management, with clear documentation outlining the \npurpose, duration, and scope of access. No third-party access will be granted without proper authorization.\nThird-party access is restricted and closely monitored to ensure that external entities are granted system access only when necessary, with \nappropriate safeguards in place to detect and address any unauthorized activity.\n3.7 Application and System Accounts\nApplication and system accounts will be managed to ensure access is limited to only what is necessary for system operability and will follow \nstrict guidelines for security.\nProvisioning of Accounts: All application and system accounts will be provisioned based on documented authorization from \nmanagement. Access privileges will be limited to only what is necessary for the application or system to function effectively, \nminimizing unnecessary access.\nInteractive Login Management: \nPrevention of Interactive Use: Interactive login through system or application accounts will be prevented unless specifically \nrequired for an exceptional circumstance. \nTime-Limited Access: If interactive access is required, it will be restricted to the necessary timeframe to complete the required \ntask. \nBusiness Justification: A documented business justification must accompany any request for interactive login, explaining why \nsuch access is necessary.\nManagement Approval: Interactive use must be explicitly approved by management, ensuring that only authorized personnel can \nuse the account.\nAccountability: Every action taken using an interactive account must be attributable to an individual user. Individual user identity \nwill be confirmed before access is granted.\nApplication and system accounts will be tightly controlled to ensure that they are only used for necessary system operations, with interactive \naccess limited to exceptional circumstances and approved by management. Every action must be linked to an identifiable user to maintain \naccountability.\n3.8 Use of Utility Programs\nAccess to utility programs that have the potential to bypass normal operating system or application controls will be restricted to authorized \npersonnel to maintain the security and integrity of the company's systems.\nRestricted Access to Utility Programs: Only authorized system administrators will have access to manage utility programs such as \nanti-virus consoles, diagnostic tools, patching software, backup utilities, and network tools. These programs will be restricted from \ngeneral user access due to their ability to bypass normal security controls.\nPrivileged Utility Access Control: \nStandard User Restrictions: Standard users will be restricted from accessing privileged utilities or making modifications to their \nconfigurations.\n\nAuthentication and Access Controls: Strict authentication mechanisms and access controls will be implemented to ensure only \nauthorized administrators can access or modify utility programs, preventing unauthorized changes to the system.\nUtility programs with the ability to bypass security controls will be strictly restricted to authorized system administrators, with standard users \ndenied access. This ensures the integrity of system configurations and limits unauthorized access to privileged tools.\n3.9 Employee Termination/Offboarding Procedures\nThe company will revoke system and physical access for terminated users (employees, third parties, vendors, and other personnel) \npromptly to safeguard its systems and data.\nAccess Revocation: System and physical access will be revoked within one business day of the termination date. This applies to all \nterminated users including employees, vendors, and third parties.\nTermination Checklist and Notification:\nThe HR/People department, along with the users and their supervisors, are responsible for notifying system administrators of \nupcoming separations and ensuring the completion of a \"Termination Checklist.\"\nSystem administrators will terminate access rights within the established service level agreements (SLAs) upon notification of \ntermination or separation.\nAsset Return Tracking: \nThe HR/People department (or designated department) will track the return of all electronic and physical assets, including \nlaptops, files, access mechanisms (such as keys, access cards, badges, and multi-factor authentication tokens) as part of the \noffboarding process.\nIncident-Based Access Termination:\nSystem administrators will terminate a user's access if there is evidence or suspicion that:\nThe user has been misusing their access rights.\nA user's password has been compromised. If the user is not responsible for the password compromise, a new password may \nbe provided.\nUpon termination, the company ensures that access to systems and physical locations is revoked within one business day, while the \nHR/People department oversees asset returns and the completion of termination procedures. Access is also terminated if there is misuse or \nevidence of a password compromise.\n3.10 Disabling Accounts: High-Risk Users\nThe company will disable accounts of users deemed to pose a high risk to its systems and data. Accounts will be disabled for a specified \nperiod depending on the risk severity.\nUser intends to sell company information to a competitor Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser accesses unauthorized sensitive data without a business \nneed \nImmediately                 3 weeks                     \nUser deliberately attempts to bypass security controls Immediately                 6 weeks                     \nUser leaks confidential information to external parties Immediately                 2 months                    \nUser violates policy by sharing credentials Immediately                 2 weeks                     \nUser installs unauthorized software or malware Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser repeatedly fails to comply with security procedures Immediately                 4 weeks                     \nUser uses company resources for illegal activities Immediately                 Permanent Disablement       \nRiskTime Period to DisableDuration of Disablement\n\nHigh-risk accounts will be disabled promptly based on the nature of the risk and the severity of the violation.

All identified security findings, such as vulnerabilities in \nsoftware, systems, or processes, are tracked to resolution to ensure comprehensive remediation.\nReporting a Finding: Upon the identification of a vulnerability, a Jira ticket is created. This ticket includes a description of the finding, \nfurther details without any confidential information, and a link to the source of the issue.\nPriority Assignment: Each finding will be assigned a priority level within Jira based on its severity and potential impact on the \ncompany's systems and operations. The following priority levels are used:\nCritical\nHigh\nMedium\nLow\nTracking and Retention: The records of all findings are retained in Jira for a minimum period of 3 years, ensuring that the findings are \ndocumented for future audits, reviews, or follow-ups.\nRemediation Process: Once a finding is identified and recorded, it will be assigned to the owner responsible for the affected system or \nsoftware package. The assignee is responsible for addressing the finding according to the established Service Level Agreements \n(SLAs). Remediation can be completed through:\nImplementing a valid fix or mitigation.\nDetermining the finding is a false positive.\nDocumenting an approved exception when a fix is not feasible.\nValidation and Closure: After remediation, the finding is reassigned to the reporter or a member of the security team for validation. If \nvalidated, the finding is marked as closed in Jira. Fixes must be deployed to a development environment and have a targeted release \ndate for production deployment.\nThe company uses Jira to track and manage security vulnerabilities. All findings are reported, prioritized, and tracked to ensure they are \nremediated promptly, ensuring the security of the company's systems and data.\n3.5 Reporting a Finding\nUpon the identification of a vulnerability (whether in software, systems, or processes), a Jira ticket will be created.\nTicket Creation: A Jira ticket must be opened to record the vulnerability. This ticket acts as the primary means of documenting and \ntracking the issue through its lifecycle.\nDescription: The description of the finding should include comprehensive details about the vulnerability, while ensuring no confidential \ninformation is included. The description should provide a clear understanding of the issue and, where applicable, a link to the source of \nthe finding.\nPriority Assignment: The finding will be assigned a priority level in Jira based on its severity and potential impact. These levels include:\nCritical\nHigh\nMedium\nLow\nAll identified vulnerabilities are documented in Jira, with appropriate details and a priority level assigned. This process ensures \nvulnerabilities are properly tracked from discovery to remediation.\n3.6 Priority/Severity Ratings and Service Level Agreements\nIn order to address security vulnerabilities efficiently, the company has established the following timelines (Service Level Agreements - \nSLAs) for different priority levels. Each level is defined by its impact and specific examples.\nPriority LevelSLADescriptionImpactExamples\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities are categorized by their priority, with defined SLAs to ensure prompt resolution. The priority may change based on \nnew findings, which will adjust the response timeline accordingly.\n3.7 Priority Updates\nThe management of security vulnerabilities includes the flexibility to adjust priorities based on new information or a better understanding of \nthe impact and likelihood of exploitation. As a result, the following processes are applied when a priority is either upgraded or downgraded:\nPriority Upgrade: When new information or an increased threat is identified, the priority of a vulnerability may be upgraded (e.g., from \nMedium to High or Critical). In such cases, the SLA is reset, starting from the moment the escalation was made. This ensures that \nmore immediate attention is given to the vulnerability, and remediation efforts are accelerated based on its new urgency. The goal is to \nreflect the increased risk posed by the vulnerability and address it as quickly as possible.\nPriority Downgrade: When further analysis reveals that a vulnerability poses less risk than initially assessed, the priority may be \ndowngraded (e.g., from Critical to Medium). In this situation, the SLA remains unchanged and continues to follow the original timeline \nestablished when the vulnerability was first identified. This ensures that there is no undue delay in remediation, while still allowing for \nlower-priority vulnerabilities to be resolved within a more appropriate timeframe.\nThese updates help ensure that vulnerabilities are treated with the appropriate level of urgency and that remediation timelines remain \naligned with the evolving threat landscape.\n3.8 Resolving a Finding\nThe process for resolving a vulnerability finding is structured to ensure proper accountability and timely remediation. The following steps \noutline how findings should be handled:\nAssignment of Ownership: Each finding must be assigned to the owner responsible for the system, software package, or component \nwhere the vulnerability exists. The owner is accountable for ensuring that the finding is addressed appropriately.\nAddressing Findings Within SLAs: All findings must be resolved according to the established Service Level Agreements (SLAs) based \non the severity and priority level of the vulnerability. It is crucial that these timelines are adhered to, ensuring vulnerabilities are \nCritical 24-48 hoursImmediate action required; vulnerabilities \nthat pose an imminent threat, such as \nremote code execution, data theft, or \nadmin privilege escalation. These must be \naddressed as a top priority to prevent \nsevere impact.\nVulnerabilities causing \nprivilege escalation to \nadmin, remote code \nexecution, financial theft, \nunauthorized access, or \ndata extraction. \nRCE, Vertical \nAuthentication Bypass, \nSSRF, XXE, SQL Injection, \nUser Authentication \nBypass. \nHigh 3-7 daysHigh-risk vulnerabilities that could \nseriously affect security or business \noperations, but are less urgent than critical \nvulnerabilities. They still require swift \naction to prevent exploitation.\nVulnerabilities affecting \nthe platform's security \nand processes. \nLateral Authentication \nBypass, Stored XSS, some \nCSRF depending on \nimpact. \nMedium 15-30 daysModerate vulnerabilities that pose a risk \nbut require specific conditions to exploit, \nsuch as user interaction or specific \nconfigurations. These should be resolved \nwithin a month.\nVulnerabilities affecting \nmultiple users, requiring \nminimal user interaction \nto trigger. \nReflective XSS, Direct \nObject Reference, URL \nRedirect, some CSRF \ndepending on impact. \nLow 30-90 daysLow-risk vulnerabilities with minimal impact \nor requiring significant effort to exploit. \nThese can be addressed over a longer \nperiod but should still be tracked and \nresolved.\nIssues affecting singular \nusers, requiring \nsignificant interaction or \nprerequisites (e.g., MitM \nattacks). \nCommon flaws, Debug \nInformation, Mixed \nContent. \n\nremediated in a timely manner to minimize risks.\nRestrictions on Deployment: No software should be deployed to the production environment if it contains unresolved Critical or High \nfindings. An exception to this policy may be granted only if an approved Exception is in place, detailing compensating controls or \nacceptable risks for the specific case.\nResolution Methods: A vulnerability finding may be resolved by one of the following methods:\nFix/Mitigation: Providing and implementing a valid fix or mitigation that effectively addresses the identified vulnerability.\nFalse Positive: Determining that the finding is a false positive after proper validation, meaning the issue does not pose a real \nsecurity risk.\nApproved Exception: Documenting an approved exception, where a viable or immediate fix is not available, but compensating \ncontrols are in place to mitigate the risk.\nThis structured process ensures that vulnerabilities are systematically addressed, and that the organization remains protected from potential \nsecurity threats.\n3.9 Closing a Finding\nOnce a vulnerability finding has been addressed, the following steps must be followed to ensure proper closure:\nResolution and Comment: The assignee responsible for addressing the finding must provide a valid resolution, such as a fix, \nmitigation, or documented exception. A comment should be added to the finding in the tracking system detailing the resolution process.\nReassignment for Validation: After resolution, the finding should be re-assigned to the original Reporter or a designated member of the \nsecurity team for validation. This step ensures that the solution is reviewed and confirmed to have addressed the identified vulnerability.\nMarking the Finding as Closed: Upon successful validation by the security team or reporter, the finding can be marked as \"Done\" or \nclosed in the tracking system. However, before the finding is officially closed, the implemented fix must be deployed to a development \nenvironment for testing.\nProduction Release Planning: The final step before closure requires that the targeted release date for deploying the fix to the \nproduction environment is documented in the ticket. This ensures transparency and allows for tracking when the fix will be fully \nimplemented.\nThis process ensures that findings are not only resolved but also validated and tracked through to deployment, ensuring the security of \nsystems and compliance with internal standards.\n3.10 Exceptions\nIn certain cases, a viable or direct fix to a vulnerability may not be available. When this occurs, an Exception can be requested following the \nguidelines below:\nWhen to Request an Exception: An Exception may be necessary if the package version containing the fix is not supported on the \ncurrent operating system or if the fix introduces other technical constraints. \nCompensating Controls: In lieu of a direct fix, an alternative solution or compensating control must be implemented to mitigate the risk \nposed by the vulnerability. Compensating controls can be technical solutions or procedural changes and must address the original \nvulnerability effectively to lower the associated risk to an acceptable level.\nException Submission: The Exception must be formally requested through the tracking system (e.g., Jira) by creating a ticket \nspecifically for the Exception. The Exception ticket should include detailed information about why the vulnerability cannot be directly \naddressed, and a description of the compensating controls in place.\nReference to the Original Finding: The Exception ticket must be linked to the original vulnerability Finding by adding an Issue Link in \nthe tracking system, ensuring a clear connection between the two items.\nReview and Approval: Each Exception request must undergo a thorough review process. The Security Officer and the asset owner \nimpacted by the vulnerability must review and approve the Exception before it can be implemented. This ensures that the alternative \nsolution provides sufficient security and risk mitigation.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that all Exceptions are adequately documented, reviewed, and monitored, providing a controlled process \nfor managing vulnerabilities when a direct fix is not feasible.\n3.11 Malware Protection\nThe company will implement an anti-malware solution on all identified endpoints and system components at risk for malware. The anti-\nmalware solution will follow these guidelines:\nDetection and Removal: The anti-malware solution will be configured to detect all known types of malware and take appropriate \nactions, including removal, blocking, or containment of the malware to prevent damage or infection to company systems.\nAutomatic Updates: The anti-malware solution will be kept up-to-date automatically to ensure the system can defend against newly \nidentified threats.\nPeriodic and Real-Time Scanning: The anti-malware software will perform periodic scans and will continuously monitor the system via \nactive or real-time scanning. If behavioral analysis is implemented, it will monitor system processes for suspicious activities.\nRemovable Media Scans: When removable electronic media (e.g., USB drives) is inserted, connected, or logically mounted, the anti-\nmalware solution will automatically scan it for potential threats. If continuous behavioral analysis is enabled, the system will analyze the \nmedia for malware or other suspicious behavior throughout its use.\nAudit Logging: The anti-malware system will generate and retain audit logs of all malware scans, detections, and responses for a \nminimum period of 12 months. These logs will ensure traceability and monitoring of malware-related events.\nAccess Control: Configuration modifications to the anti-malware solution will be restricted to authorized personnel only. Regular users \nwill not be permitted to disable or alter the anti-malware protection mechanisms, except under specific circumstances where \nmanagement has documented and authorized an exception for a limited time.\nThe malware protection system will ensure comprehensive security by automating updates, scanning, and behavioral analysis. Controls \nover access to the anti-malware system will prevent unauthorized modifications, and audit logs will track system performance over time.\n3.12 Phishing Protection\nThe company will implement processes and automated mechanisms to detect and protect against phishing attacks aimed at personnel and \nsystems. The following measures will be included:\nEmail Security Protocols: Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) and DomainKeys Identified \nMail (DKIM) will be deployed to authenticate email origins and ensure that incoming emails are from trusted sources.\nLink Scrubbers: Automated systems will be used to scrub links within emails and web pages to detect and block malicious or suspicious \nURLs that may lead to phishing websites.\nServer-Side Antivirus: Server-side antivirus solutions will be used to scan emails and attachments before they reach user inboxes, \nreducing the risk of phishing and malware.\nContinuous Monitoring: Phishing detection systems will be continuously monitored to identify and respond to phishing attempts in real \ntime. Alerts and responses will be configured to mitigate risk and prevent users from interacting with phishing content.\nThe company will proactively guard against phishing attempts through automated email security protocols, link scrubbing technologies, and \nserver-side antivirus solutions. These mechanisms ensure the detection and mitigation of phishing threats before they reach personnel, \nenhancing overall cybersecurity.\n4 Document Administration\n4.1 Ownership and Review\n \nThe Document Owner owns this Document and is responsible for reviewing the Document for updates annually, or following any major \nchanges to Squirro AG's compliance environment.

security program is a holistic and systematic approach to risk management. This policy defines the \nrequirements and processes for the company to identify information security risks. The process consists of four parts: identification of the \ncompany's assets, as well as the threats and vulnerabilities that apply; assessment of the likelihood and consequence (risk) of the threats \nand vulnerabilities being realized, identification of treatment for each unacceptable risk, and evaluation of the residual risk after treatment.\n3.1 Risk Assessment\nThe company follows a comprehensive risk assessment process to identify, evaluate, and manage risks related to company assets. This \nprocess ensures appropriate controls and treatment measures are applied to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.\nAsset Identification: All assets within the scope of the information security program are identified, including documents \n(paper/electronic), applications, databases, IT equipment, infrastructure, and external services. Each asset is assigned an owner.\nThreat and Vulnerability Identification: Threats and vulnerabilities for each asset are documented in a risk assessment table. Multiple \nthreats and vulnerabilities may be associated with a single asset.\nRisk Ownership: A risk owner is assigned to each identified risk. The risk owner may also be the asset owner.\nRisk Assessment: The risk owner evaluates the impact and likelihood for each combination of threats and vulnerabilities. Impact and \nlikelihood are measured based on predefined criteria, and the risk level is calculated by multiplying the impact score and likelihood score.\nThe risk assessment process provides a structured method to identify risks, assign ownership, and determine the severity of risks to \ncompany assets.\n3.2 Risk Assessment Process\n1. Asset Identification \nThe first step in the risk assessment process is to identify all assets within the scope of the company's information security program. \nThese assets may impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information within the organization. Assets can include:\nDocuments in paper or electronic form\nApplications, databases, and software\nInformation technology equipment (servers, computers, etc.)\nPhysical infrastructure (offices, data centers)\nExternal/outsourced services and processes\nEach asset must have an assigned owner responsible for managing its security.\n2. Threat and Vulnerability Identification \nFor each identified asset, potential threats and vulnerabilities must be documented. This includes any factors that could lead to \nunauthorized access, data breaches, or system failures. Threats and vulnerabilities must be compiled in a risk assessment table for \neasier tracking. Each asset can have multiple associated threats, and each threat can have multiple vulnerabilities.\n3. Risk Ownership \nFor every identified risk (a combination of threats and vulnerabilities), a risk owner must be assigned. This individual will be responsible \n\nfor managing and mitigating the risk. The risk owner may be the same individual as the asset owner.\n4. Risk Assessment Criteria \nOnce threats and vulnerabilities are identified, the risk owner assesses two key factors:\nImpact: The potential consequences if the threat exploits the vulnerability. The impact can range from minimal loss (e.g., local media \nattention) to extreme loss (e.g., massive financial loss, long-term international media coverage).\nLikelihood: The probability that the threat will exploit the vulnerability. This is typically rated on a scale from \"rare\" (once in 100+ \nyears) to \"certain\" (up to once every 2 years).\n5. Risk Level Calculation \nAfter determining the impact and likelihood of each risk, the overall risk level is calculated by multiplying the two scores. The risk level \nhelps prioritize risks and determines the need for treatment based on their severity.\n6. Risk Assessment Documentation \nAll findings from the assessment, including the assets, threats, vulnerabilities, and risk levels, are recorded in a Risk Assessment \nReport for future reference and review.\nThis structured approach ensures that all potential risks are thoroughly identified, assessed, and managed to protect the company's \ninformation and operational security.\n3.3 Risk Impact and Likelihood\nThis section defines the methodology used by the company to assess and quantify risks. Risks are measured based on two primary factors: \nimpact and likelihood. The impact measures the potential consequences of a risk, while likelihood evaluates how probable the risk is to \noccur. The combination of these two factors results in an overall risk score, which is then categorized into Low, Medium, or High risk levels. \nUnderstanding these criteria enables the organization to prioritize risk management efforts effectively.\n3.3.1 Impact\nThis table outlines the criteria for evaluating the impact of a risk. The impact level measures the severity of the consequences if a risk \nmaterializes, ranging from minimal to massive financial loss, reputational damage, regulatory issues, and customer dissatisfaction. These \nimpact levels help the company determine how critical a risk is and what actions are necessary to mitigate it.\n1 - IncidentalMinimal loss (<= CHF \n10'000) \nLocal media \nattention, quickly \nremedied \nNot reportable to \nregulator \nNo effect on \ncustomers, only \ninternal effects \nIsolated staff \ndissatisfaction \n2 - MinorMinor financial loss \n(CHF 10'000 - 50'000) \nLocal reputational \ndamage, minimal \nimpact \nReportable incident, \nno follow-up required \nCustomers affected \nwith minimal impact, \nno negative \nreputation \nGeneral morale \nproblems, slight \nturnover increase \n3 - ModerateModerate financial \nloss (CHF 50'000 - \n250'000) \nNational short-\nterm negative \nmedia coverage \nBreach report to \nregulator, immediate \ncorrection required \nCustomer annoyance, \nsome loss of \nconfidence \nWidespread morale \nproblems, high staff \nturnover \n4 - MajorSignificant financial \nloss (CHF 250'000 - \n500'000) \nNational long-term \nnegative media \ncoverage, market \nshare loss \nReport to regulator, \nmajor corrective \nproject needed \nStrongly affected \ncustomers, loss of \ntrust, multiple-week \nnegative publicity \nSenior management \nturnover, high \nexperienced staff \nturnover \n5 - ExtremeMassive financial loss \n(> CHF 500'000) \nInternational long-\nterm negative \nmedia, game-\nSignificant fines, \nlitigation, leadership \nprosecution \nCustomers severely \nimpacted (financially, \nMultiple senior \nleaders leave, severe \nstaff dissatisfaction \nImpact LevelFinancialReputationRegulatoryCustomerStaff\n\n3.3.2 Likelihood\nThe likelihood criteria evaluate the probability that a risk will occur. Likelihood is rated on a scale from Rare to Certain, based on the \nfrequency and probability of occurrence. Understanding the likelihood helps the company determine the frequency of potential risks and \nplan accordingly.\n3.3.3 Risk Criticality\nThe risk rating criteria combine the impact and likelihood values to calculate an overall risk score. This score helps categorize risks into \ndifferent levels: Low, Medium, or High. The risk score guides decision-making for prioritizing risk treatments and allocating resources for \nmitigation. \n3.4 Risk Score Matrix\nThe company uses a Risk Score Matrix to calculate risk levels based on the combination of impact and likelihood scores (multiplication).\nThe Risk Score Matrix provides a visual tool to categorize risks based on their combined impact and likelihood, ranging from Low to High.\nchanging market \nloss\nreputation-wise), \nlong-term loss of trust \n1 - RareOnce in 10 to 50 years (<2% chance of occurrence over the life of the company)\n2 - UnlikelyOnce in 5 to 10 years (2%-10% chance of occurrence over the life of the company)\n3 - PossibleOnce in 1 to 5 years (10%-20% chance of occurrence over the life of the company)\n4 - Likely1 time per year (20%-90% chance of occurrence over the life of the company)\n5 - CertainSeveral times per year (90-100% chance of occurrence over the life of the company)\nLikelihoodLikelihood\n1 - LowLess than or equal to 4\n2 - Medium Greater than 4 but less than or equal to 12\n3 - High Greater than 12\nRiskRisk Score\n1 - Incidental2 - Minor3 - Moderate4 - Major5 - Extreme\nLI\nKE\nLI\nHO\nOD\n1 - Rare1 - Low 2 - Low 3 - Low 4 - Low 5 - Medium \n2 - Unlikely2 - Low 4 - Low 6 - Medium 8 - Medium 10 - Medium \n3 - Possible3 - Low 6 - Medium 9 - Medium 12 - Medium 15 - High \n4 - Likely4 - Low 8 - Medium 12 - Medium 16 - High20 - High\n5 - Certain5 - Medium 10 - Medium 15 - High 20 - High25 - High\n IMPACT\n\n3.5 Risk Classification\nRisk classification involves identifying and categorizing potential risks that could affect the organization. It provides a structured way to \nassess different aspects of risks, including their nature, the actors involved, the assets and processes affected, and the timing of their \ndiscovery and occurrence. This helps the organization to develop appropriate responses and mitigation strategies.\nThe section is divided into the following categories:\nThreat Type: Describes the source or nature of the risks.\nActor: Identifies the internal or external entities activating/acting in the risk scenario.\nAsset/Process: Defines the critical assets or processes within the organization that could be impacted by risks.\nTime until Discovery: Describes how quickly the risk or incident is identified.\nTime of Occurrence: Evaluates the criticality of risks based on when they occur in business operations.\n3.5.1 Threat Type\nThis parameter categorizes different types of threats that the organization might face. These threats can arise from natural events, technical \nmalfunctions, organizational issues, human error, or malicious actions. Each threat type has distinct characteristics, requiring different \napproaches for risk management.\n3.5.2 Actor\nThis parameter identifies the actors that can cause or contribute to risks. Actors can be internal (within the organization) or external (outside \nthe organization). Understanding the sources of risks, whether they stem from employees or external factors like regulators or competitors, \nhelps in developing targeted risk mitigation strategies.\n3.5.3 Asset/Process\nThis parameter identifies the assets and processes that could be affected by risks. These include human resources, the organizational \nstructure, reputation, business processes, and IT infrastructure. By classifying these assets, the organization can better understand which \nForce majeureEarthquake, storm, flood—natural events beyond control that disrupt \noperations and infrastructure.\nTechnical IssueSoftware errors, technical failures, system overloads, environmental \nfactors affecting IT systems.\nOrganizational IssueDeficient processes or instructions, lack of documentation, insufficient \ninternal knowledge.\nUnintentional MishandlingHuman errors such as mistyping, mishandling, or failure to comply with \nregulations.\nIntentional ActionsDeliberate acts like sabotage, theft, malware, espionage, or social \nengineering.\nExternal RequirementChanges in laws or regulations that impose new compliance obligations.\nThreatDescription\nInternalEmployees, contractors, freelancers within the organization.\nExternalEntities outside the organization, such as regulators, business partners, or \ncompetitors.\nActorDescription\n\nareas are most vulnerable and require protection.\n3.5.4 Time until discovery\nThis parameter categorizes risks based on how quickly they are discovered after occurrence. The speed of discovery can have a significant \nimpact on the damage caused by the risk and the response needed. Some risks are detected immediately, while others may be found only \nafter a delay or by accident.\n3.5.5 Time of occurrence\nThis parameter categorizes risks based on when they occur relative to the organization's operational timeline. The criticality of a risk can \nvary depending on its timing, with some incidents having a severe impact if they occur at a crucial time, while others may have a minor \neffect if they occur during non-essential periods.\n3.6 Risk Remediation and Treatment\nRisk treatment refers to the process of deciding how to handle identified risks based on their potential impact and likelihood. There are four \nprimary approaches for addressing risks: Mitigate, Transfer, Avoid, and Accept. Each option depends on the organization's risk appetite, \nthe nature of the risk, and the cost-benefit analysis of implementing controls.\nHumanKnowledge and capabilities of personnel necessary for business operations.\nOrg. structureThe organizational structure defining management hierarchies and workflows.\nReputationThe organization's public image and trustworthiness.\nProcessThe business processes that are essential for delivering products or services.\nInfrastructureIT infrastructure, including hardware, software, and networking components.\nDevicesEnd-user devices such as laptops, printers, and workplace equipment.\nBusiness SupportApplications and services essential for supporting business operations (e.g., CRM, \nERP).\nInformationData and information required to execute business processes.\nAsset/ProcessDescription\nImmediateThe risk or incident is detected as it happens, allowing for an immediate response.\nWith delayThe risk or incident is discovered after a period of time, resulting in a delayed \nresponse.\nBy accidentThe risk or incident is discovered unintentionally, usually through unrelated activities.\nTimeDescription\nCriticalRisk or incident occurs during a crucial business period, such as year-end accounting \nfailures.\nNon-criticalRisk or incident occurs at a non-essential time, such as a one-day payroll system \noutage at the beginning of the month.\nTimeDescription\n\n3.6.1 Mitigate\nDeveloping or enhancing security controls to reduce the likelihood or impact of identified risks. These controls (measures) may be \ntechnological, procedural, physical, or people-focused in nature and are designed to manage risks to an acceptable level. Below are the \nkey types of security measures, grouped by category:\nTechnical: \nControls involving the use of technology to reduce risks. These include: controls like firewalls, encryption, and intrusion detection \nsystems designed to protect data, networks, and systems from cyber threats.\nProcedural: \nControls that govern how processes and tasks should be executed to mitigate risks. These include:\nGuidelines: Procedural instructions to guide behavior and decision-making in line with security standards.\nPolicy: Formal documents outlining security rules and practices to ensure compliance and proper governance.\nProcess: Standardized procedures, such as incident response or change management, that ensure tasks are performed consistently \nand securely.\nPhysical:\nControls that protect the organization's physical assets, environments, and infrastructure. These include: Access control systems: \nDevices such as biometric scanners, key cards, or PIN codes to control physical access to secure areas. Surveillance: Monitoring \nthrough cameras or security personnel to detect and respond to physical security breaches. Environmental controls: Systems like fire \nsuppression, temperature, and humidity control to protect data centers and critical infrastructure. Physical barriers: Locks, fences, \nsecurity gates, or other barriers to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive areas.\nPeople-focused: \nControls that focus on managing human factors in security. These include:\nPeople: Human-centric controls such as role-based access control and personnel management to ensure that employees are well-\nequipped to handle security responsibilities.\nTraining: Educational programs aimed at increasing staff awareness and knowledge of security risks, ensuring they can recognize \nand respond to threats effectively.\nThese grouped measures provide a comprehensive approach to managing risks, addressing both technical and human factors, and \nensuring that security is integrated across all aspects of the organization.\nHigh risks must be mitigated through the development or selection of appropriate security controls.\nExamples of mitigation controls include:\nImplementing firewalls and encryption for data protection.\nEstablishing formal procedures and protocols for incident response.\nSecuring physical access to sensitive equipment.\n3.6.2 Transfer\nTransferring the risk to a third party by purchasing insurance, outsourcing risk-prone activities, or signing contracts with vendors. This \napproach shifts some or all of the financial burden or operational responsibility to another entity.\nRisks may be transferred through methods such as insurance policies, contracts with suppliers, or outsourcing to specialized service \nproviders.\nExamples of risk transfer include:\nPurchasing cybersecurity insurance to cover potential breaches.\nContracting with a third-party vendor for data storage with explicit security requirements.\nOutsourcing payroll or HR services to an external provider.\n\n3.6.3 Avoid\nEliminating the risk entirely by discontinuing the business activity or process that leads to the risk. This option is suitable when the risk \npresents an unacceptably high likelihood of occurrence or impact.\nAvoiding risks involves ceasing activities that introduce the identified risk.\nExamples of risk avoidance include:\nDiscontinuing the use of legacy systems that cannot be secured effectively.\nCancelling projects or products that introduce significant security vulnerabilities.\nAvoiding the use of certain high-risk technologies or suppliers.\n3.6.4 Accept\nAccepting the risk if the cost of mitigating or transferring it outweighs the potential impact. This approach is typically used for low-level risks \nor where the cost of controls is prohibitively high.\nAcceptance of a risk is only permissible after a thorough analysis that demonstrates the cost of implementing controls is higher than the \npotential impact of the risk.\nExamples of risk acceptance include:\nContinuing to operate with known low-impact vulnerabilities due to the high cost of remediation.\nMaintaining legacy equipment with a known, manageable risk until a scheduled upgrade.\n3.7 Risk Remediation and Treatment Process\n1. Risk Identification and Prioritization \nFollowing the risk assessment process, all identified risks are categorized based on their severity. Risks are classified as low, medium, \nor high based on the calculated risk level (multiplying the impact and likelihood scores).\n2. Objective Setting for Risk Treatment \nThe company establishes specific objectives for mitigating or treating the risks, particularly focusing on high risks. While the treatment \nof medium and low risks is optional, company managers may choose to address them for continuous improvement of risk management \npractices.\n3. Risk Treatment Options \nThe company uses a mix of controls, risk transfer, avoidance, and acceptance to manage risks effectively based on their criticality. \nDepending on the nature of the risk and available resources, one of the treatment options will be selected based on risk criticality:\nLow: Risks can be accepted.\nMedium: Risks are to be avoided or mitigated by measures as far as economically and technically feasible. Can be accepted if not \nfeasible.\nHigh: Risks should be mitigated.\n4. Impact and Likelihood Reassessment \nAfter selecting a risk treatment option, the risk owner must reassess the impact and likelihood values based on the planned controls. \nThis reassessment helps determine the residual risk after implementing the treatment.\n5. Implementation and Monitoring \nOnce the treatment option is selected and the new risk levels are determined, the implementation phase begins. The company ensures \nthat the chosen controls or treatments are applied effectively, and the risk is monitored to ensure that it remains within acceptable limits.\n6. Documentation and Reporting \nThe results of the risk treatment process, including the chosen options, reassessed risk levels, and implementation status, must be \ndocumented and reported in the company's Risk Treatment Report. This report is reviewed periodically to ensure all treatments are \neffective and up to date.\n\nThis process provides a structured approach to mitigate and manage risks in alignment with the company's risk appetite and strategic \nobjectives.\n3.8 Risk Appetite and Regular Reviews\nThe company defines a moderate risk tolerance, meaning it is willing to accept some residual risk after implementing necessary controls.\nRisk Tolerance: Residual risks after controls must align with the company's moderate risk appetite.\nAnnual Review: Risk assessments must be updated annually or when new risks are identified. All updates are documented in the Risk \nAssessment Report.\nRegular reviews ensure that the company's risk management efforts remain current and aligned with its risk tolerance.\n3.9 Regular Reviews of Risk Assessment and Risk Treatment\nThe company ensures that its Risk Assessment Report is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect the latest identified risks and risk \ntreatment measures. These reviews are essential for maintaining an up-to-date understanding of risks and their potential impact.\nAnnual Review Requirement: A thorough review and update of the Risk Assessment Report must be performed at least once per \nyear to ensure continuous identification and management of risks.\nUpdate Upon New Risk Discovery: The Risk Assessment Report must be updated immediately whenever new risks are identified, \nensuring that the company remains proactive in its risk management.\nValidation of Risk Treatment: All risk treatments in place must be assessed annually to validate their effectiveness and make \nnecessary adjustments to mitigate any emerging risks or vulnerabilities.\nRegular reviews of the Risk Assessment Report ensure that risks are continuously monitored, and appropriate treatment measures are in \nplace and effective. The report must be updated annually or as new risks emerge.\n3.10 Reporting\nThe company requires that all risk assessment activities are documented thoroughly and consistently. This ensures transparency and allows \nthe company to track its risk management efforts over time.\nDocumentation of Risk Assessments: The results of all risk assessments and subsequent reviews must be recorded in the Risk \nAssessment Report to provide a clear record of identified risks and their treatments.\nMaintenance of Risk Reports: All versions of the Risk Assessment Report must be maintained securely to ensure that risk treatment \nprogress and updates are traceable and available for audit purposes.\nTransparency and Accountability: The Risk Assessment Report must reflect the company's ongoing efforts to manage and mitigate \nrisks, providing insight into the company's risk profile over time.\nAll risk assessment findings and updates must be documented in the Risk Assessment Report, ensuring a clear, traceable record for \ncompliance, audit, and ongoing risk management purposes.\n3.11 Threat Assessment Plan\nThe company's Threat Assessment Plan is designed to collect, analyze, and manage information related to existing or potential threats. \nThis plan ensures that proactive measures are in place to prevent harm to the organization. Threat assessment activities are integrated into \nthe company's risk management process, providing essential inputs for implementing safeguards.\n3.11.1 Components of the Threat Assessment Plan\nThe Threat Assessment Plan includes several key components that ensure a structured and proactive approach to identifying, managing, \nand mitigating potential threats to the company. These components integrate with the company's broader risk management and security \nframeworks to maintain business resiliency.\n\nBusiness Resiliency Threat Assessment Documentation: The company maintains comprehensive threat assessment documentation \nto systematically identify and evaluate potential threats. This documentation serves as a reference point for business continuity and \nresiliency efforts, ensuring that all recognized threats are reviewed, cataloged, and prioritized for further action.\nRisk Registry: A Risk Registry is maintained as part of the company's Business Resiliency Program. It plays a pivotal role in tracking \nand managing all identified risks. The registry offers a structured method for ongoing monitoring and ensures that risks are regularly \nassessed and mitigated in alignment with business priorities.\nSecurity Incident Management: The company enforces established policies, procedures, and plans for the handling of security \nincidents. Annual incident response exercises and training are conducted to ensure the workforce is adequately prepared to respond \nto security events. This preparedness helps improve the effectiveness of response measures and enhances the overall security posture.\nPeriodic Review of Access Rights: Periodic reviews of both logical and physical access rights are performed to verify that only \nauthorized personnel have access to critical systems and data. These reviews are essential to maintaining security standards and \nreducing the likelihood of unauthorized access. Reviews are conducted in accordance with the company's Access Control Policies and \nare a key part of its overall security framework.\nGovernance Activities: Regular governance activities, including meetings with executive management, ensure that the threat \nassessment process remains aligned with the company's organizational goals. These meetings provide oversight of the threat \nassessment activities and reinforce the company's commitment to continuous improvement in threat detection, analysis, and mitigation.\nThe Components of the Threat Assessment Plan provide a comprehensive approach to identifying, evaluating, and managing threats. \nThrough well-documented assessments, continuous risk tracking, incident management exercises, and governance oversight, the company \nmaintains a strong and proactive threat management process. This ensures resilience against potential threats and supports the overall risk \nmanagement framework.\n3.11.2 Threat Assessment Plan Implementation\nThe Threat Assessment Plan is a critical component of the company's overall risk management framework. It ensures that threat \nassessment activities are continuously integrated and aligned with the company's security goals, enabling proactive identification, \nevaluation, and communication of potential threats that may affect the company's operations, assets, and reputation.\nIntegration into Risk Management Framework: The threat assessment plan is embedded within the broader Risk Management \nFramework to ensure that threat intelligence and assessment activities are conducted in parallel with risk assessments. This alignment \nensures that both internal and external threats are considered in the decision-making process for risk treatment and security strategies.\nIdentification of Emerging Threats: The plan involves the systematic identification of new and emerging threats. This includes \nanalyzing threat data from a variety of sources, including security incident reports, threat intelligence feeds, and industry reports. The \ncompany actively monitors for any changes in the threat landscape that could impact its systems, operations, or personnel.\nEvaluation and Prioritization of Threats: Once threats are identified, they are evaluated for their potential impact on company assets \nand operations. The evaluation process includes assigning threat levels based on factors such as likelihood, potential damage, and the \ncompany's risk tolerance. High-priority threats are addressed through immediate risk treatment or mitigation measures, while lower-level \nthreats are continuously monitored.\nCommunication and Reporting: Clear communication channels are established to ensure that threat assessment findings are shared \nwith key stakeholders within the company. This includes regular reports to executive management, the security team, and risk \nowners. Threat reports are used to inform risk treatment decisions, update security controls, and make recommendations for additional \nsafeguards.\nContinuous Monitoring and Review: The Threat Assessment Plan is not static; it is reviewed and updated regularly to account for \nevolving threats and changing business conditions. The company performs periodic reviews to ensure that the threat assessment \nprocess remains effective and that any changes in the threat landscape are promptly addressed. Threat assessments are aligned with \nthe company's overall security and business continuity plans.\nCollaboration with External Entities: To enhance threat intelligence, the company may collaborate with external partners, industry \ngroups, and government agencies. This collaboration helps gather additional insights on potential threats and enables the company to \nstay ahead of adversarial tactics and techniques.\nThe Threat Assessment Plan is a dynamic and integral part of the company's security strategy, seamlessly integrated with the broader risk \nmanagement framework. By continuously identifying, evaluating, and communicating emerging threats, the company ensures proactive \n\nresponses to potential risks, thereby strengthening its overall security posture and resilience.\n4 Document Administration\n4.1 Ownership and Review\n \n4.2 Monitoring and Enforcement\n4.3 Related Documents\n4.3.1 Internal documents\nInformation Security Policy \nInformation Security Organization Policy\n4.4 Approvals\n4.5 Revision History\nFollow the link for details of revisions. \nThe Document Owner owns this Document and is responsible for reviewing the Document for updates annually, or following any major \nchanges to Squirro AG's compliance environment.

All \naccess is regulated using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), adhering to the Principle of Least Privilege to ensure that each user has \nonly the necessary access required to perform their duties.\nMinimum Necessary Access: User access to systems is determined by job classification, ensuring that only the minimum necessary \nlevel of access is granted.\nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC): The assignment of user rights and access to systems is regulated by the RBAC method, \nensuring that access levels align with user roles and responsibilities.\nSegregation of Duties: The need for segregation of duties is considered when assigning user rights, preventing potential conflicts of \ninterest or undue concentration of authority.\nFormal Documentation and Authorization: All access requests, including the addition, deletion, and modification of user IDs, \nauthentication factors, and other identifying objects, must be documented and formally authorized.\nAccess Request Process: Workforce members initiate access requests by creating an issue in the company's ticketing system, \ndetailing the type of access needed.\nIdentity Verification: User identities must be verified in person whenever possible before granting access to new accounts. For remote \nemployees, verification may be conducted over the phone, with the method of verification recorded in the ticketing system.\nAuthorization by Security Officer: The Security Officer is responsible for granting or rejecting access based on the employee's role \nand job classification. If additional access is required, the requester must provide a valid reason as part of the request.\nReview and Documentation: If an access request is rejected, it must go through a further review process, with detailed documentation. \nApproved requests are marked as complete and include all pertinent notes.\nAccess to the company's systems is carefully regulated through RBAC, ensuring that users are granted only the minimum necessary access \nfor their roles. Formal documentation and identity verification are required, with reviews conducted for additional access requests to \nmaintain security and accountability.\n3.2 Access Reviews\nUser access to company systems and services will be subject to periodic reviews to ensure that accounts, including third-party or vendor \naccounts, are appropriately assigned based on job functions. These reviews help maintain compliance with the Principle of Least Privilege \nand ensure access rights are adjusted as needed.\nQuarterly Access Reviews: Management will conduct formal access reviews at least once every quarter to verify that the roles and \npermissions associated with all user accounts, including third-party or vendor accounts, are still appropriate.\nJob Function Alignment: Access reviews focus on ensuring that user roles and permissions are aligned with current job functions and \nthat no excess or unauthorized access exists.\nManagement Authorization: During the access review, management is responsible for confirming that user accounts are in compliance \nwith established authorization requirements.\nQuarterly access reviews ensure that user accounts, including third-party and vendor accounts, remain aligned with job responsibilities, \npreventing unnecessary or unauthorized access to sensitive systems. These reviews are a key part of the company's efforts to maintain \nappropriate security controls.\n3.3 User Identification and Authentication\nTo ensure the security of system components, users and administrators must be authenticated using at least one authentication factor. This \nprocess is critical to safeguarding the company's systems and sensitive information.\nAuthentication Factors: Access will require at least one of the following:\nSomething you know, such as a password or passphrase.\n\nSomething you have, such as a token device or smart card.\nSomething you are, such as a biometric element.\nUnique Login Credentials: Each user will have a unique login ID and password, ensuring individual accountability.\nAuthentication Requirements: Single sign-on (SSO) and minimum password requirements will be enforced based on the company's \nPassword Policy. Passwords will never be displayed, transmitted, or stored in plain text.\nDefault Accounts: Default accounts on all production systems, including root, will be deleted, disabled, or restricted to a limited number \nof authorized administrators. These accounts will only be used under exceptional circumstances with documented business justification \nand management approval.\nShared Accounts: The use of group, shared, or generic accounts is prohibited unless absolutely necessary and approved by \nmanagement. Individual user identity must be confirmed before access is granted, and all actions must be traceable to a specific user.\nAuthentication Tokens: Physical or logical tokens, smart cards, or certificates will be assigned to individual users and cannot be \nshared. Additional controls, such as PINs or biometric data, will ensure only authorized users can access accounts.\nAutomated Log-on: Automated log-on configurations, other than the company's approved password management tools, are prohibited \nfrom storing user passwords or bypassing password entry on workstations or production systems.\nThe company enforces strict identification and authentication policies, requiring the use of unique credentials, secure authentication factors, \nand limiting access to default and shared accounts. These measures ensure accountability and safeguard access to critical systems.\n3.4 Multi-factor Authentication\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all system access where technically feasible, providing an additional layer of security for \nusers, administrators, and third parties.\nUse of MFA: MFA will be enforced to enhance security by requiring multiple types of authentication for access to systems.\nSystem Configuration: Systems using MFA must:\nPrevent replay attacks through secure token generation and validation processes.\nRequire at least two distinct types of authentication factors (e.g., something you know, something you have, or something you are).\nRestrict any bypassing of MFA by users, including administrative users, unless specifically documented and approved by \nmanagement on an exception basis, for a limited time period.\nRemote Access: MFA is mandatory for all remote access to the company's network, including access by users, administrators, and \nthird-party vendors. This ensures that remote connections are secure and access is only granted to authenticated users.\nMulti-factor authentication is essential to securing system access, particularly for remote access scenarios. By requiring multiple \nauthentication factors and preventing unauthorized bypassing, the company maintains a high level of security for all users and systems.\n3.5 Automated Logoffs\nAutomated logoffs are implemented to secure devices and systems by minimizing unauthorized access due to inactivity.\nScreen Lock Timeout: Company-issued devices and any bring-your-own or third-party devices connected to company systems will \nenforce a screensaver lock with a timeout of 15 minutes or less of inactivity. This ensures that devices are locked when not actively in \nuse, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\nSystem Logoff: Where technically feasible, the company's applications and systems will automatically log users out after 15 minutes of \ninactivity or upon closure of the system or internet browser. This configuration secures the system by terminating sessions that may \notherwise remain vulnerable to unauthorized access.\nAutomated logoffs are an important control for ensuring security, by locking or logging out inactive sessions on both devices and systems. \nThese measures protect sensitive data by ensuring that unattended devices and open sessions are quickly secured.\n\n3.6 Third-Party Access\nThird-party access to the company's systems is strictly controlled to ensure security and accountability when external entities access critical \nsystem components.\nTime-Limited Access: Accounts provided to third parties for system access, support, or maintenance will be enabled only for the \nrequired time period. Access will be granted based on documented approval from management and will be promptly disabled once the \nspecific task is completed.\nMonitoring of Remote Access: All third-party remote access will be continuously monitored by company personnel for any signs of \nunauthorized or unexpected activity. Monitoring will include real-time oversight and logging of access events to ensure accountability and \ndetect potential security risks.\nAuthorization and Documentation: All third-party access must be authorized by management, with clear documentation outlining the \npurpose, duration, and scope of access. No third-party access will be granted without proper authorization.\nThird-party access is restricted and closely monitored to ensure that external entities are granted system access only when necessary, with \nappropriate safeguards in place to detect and address any unauthorized activity.\n3.7 Application and System Accounts\nApplication and system accounts will be managed to ensure access is limited to only what is necessary for system operability and will follow \nstrict guidelines for security.\nProvisioning of Accounts: All application and system accounts will be provisioned based on documented authorization from \nmanagement. Access privileges will be limited to only what is necessary for the application or system to function effectively, \nminimizing unnecessary access.\nInteractive Login Management: \nPrevention of Interactive Use: Interactive login through system or application accounts will be prevented unless specifically \nrequired for an exceptional circumstance. \nTime-Limited Access: If interactive access is required, it will be restricted to the necessary timeframe to complete the required \ntask. \nBusiness Justification: A documented business justification must accompany any request for interactive login, explaining why \nsuch access is necessary.\nManagement Approval: Interactive use must be explicitly approved by management, ensuring that only authorized personnel can \nuse the account.\nAccountability: Every action taken using an interactive account must be attributable to an individual user. Individual user identity \nwill be confirmed before access is granted.\nApplication and system accounts will be tightly controlled to ensure that they are only used for necessary system operations, with interactive \naccess limited to exceptional circumstances and approved by management. Every action must be linked to an identifiable user to maintain \naccountability.\n3.8 Use of Utility Programs\nAccess to utility programs that have the potential to bypass normal operating system or application controls will be restricted to authorized \npersonnel to maintain the security and integrity of the company's systems.\nRestricted Access to Utility Programs: Only authorized system administrators will have access to manage utility programs such as \nanti-virus consoles, diagnostic tools, patching software, backup utilities, and network tools. These programs will be restricted from \ngeneral user access due to their ability to bypass normal security controls.\nPrivileged Utility Access Control: \nStandard User Restrictions: Standard users will be restricted from accessing privileged utilities or making modifications to their \nconfigurations.\n\nAuthentication and Access Controls: Strict authentication mechanisms and access controls will be implemented to ensure only \nauthorized administrators can access or modify utility programs, preventing unauthorized changes to the system.\nUtility programs with the ability to bypass security controls will be strictly restricted to authorized system administrators, with standard users \ndenied access. This ensures the integrity of system configurations and limits unauthorized access to privileged tools.\n3.9 Employee Termination/Offboarding Procedures\nThe company will revoke system and physical access for terminated users (employees, third parties, vendors, and other personnel) \npromptly to safeguard its systems and data.\nAccess Revocation: System and physical access will be revoked within one business day of the termination date. This applies to all \nterminated users including employees, vendors, and third parties.\nTermination Checklist and Notification:\nThe HR/People department, along with the users and their supervisors, are responsible for notifying system administrators of \nupcoming separations and ensuring the completion of a \"Termination Checklist.\"\nSystem administrators will terminate access rights within the established service level agreements (SLAs) upon notification of \ntermination or separation.\nAsset Return Tracking: \nThe HR/People department (or designated department) will track the return of all electronic and physical assets, including \nlaptops, files, access mechanisms (such as keys, access cards, badges, and multi-factor authentication tokens) as part of the \noffboarding process.\nIncident-Based Access Termination:\nSystem administrators will terminate a user's access if there is evidence or suspicion that:\nThe user has been misusing their access rights.\nA user's password has been compromised. If the user is not responsible for the password compromise, a new password may \nbe provided.\nUpon termination, the company ensures that access to systems and physical locations is revoked within one business day, while the \nHR/People department oversees asset returns and the completion of termination procedures. Access is also terminated if there is misuse or \nevidence of a password compromise.\n3.10 Disabling Accounts: High-Risk Users\nThe company will disable accounts of users deemed to pose a high risk to its systems and data. Accounts will be disabled for a specified \nperiod depending on the risk severity.\nUser intends to sell company information to a competitor Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser accesses unauthorized sensitive data without a business \nneed \nImmediately                 3 weeks                     \nUser deliberately attempts to bypass security controls Immediately                 6 weeks                     \nUser leaks confidential information to external parties Immediately                 2 months                    \nUser violates policy by sharing credentials Immediately                 2 weeks                     \nUser installs unauthorized software or malware Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser repeatedly fails to comply with security procedures Immediately                 4 weeks                     \nUser uses company resources for illegal activities Immediately                 Permanent Disablement       \nRiskTime Period to DisableDuration of Disablement\n\nHigh-risk accounts will be disabled promptly based on the nature of the risk and the severity of the violation.

systems follow a consistent and repeatable \nSoftware Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process. This process will integrate information security at every stage to protect assets and \nmaintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\nStandardized Phases: Each software development project must follow defined SDLC phases: Determine System Need, Define System \nRequirements, Design System Components, Build System Components, Evaluate System Readiness, and System Deployment.\nIterative Cycles: Depending on the project management approach (Waterfall, Agile, Iterative), some SDLC phases can be combined or \niterated multiple times.\nSecure Engineering Principles: Security principles for business, data, application, and technology layers must be applied throughout \nthe SDLC to address risks identified via the company's information security risk assessments.\nThe company's SDLC ensures software development follows secure, standardized processes with integrated security measures at every \nstage, aligned with risk management strategies.\n3.2 Software Development Phases\nThe company's software development life cycle (SDLC) follows a structured approach consisting of several key phases, ensuring that both \nfunctional and security requirements are addressed at each step.\nDetermine System Need Phase: The initial phase where the system need is identified. During this phase, the business or technical \nneed for the system is evaluated, and resources are committed to address the requirement. This phase involves the identification of risks \nand opportunities for improving business processes through technology solutions.\nDefine System Requirements Phase: In this phase, user requirements are broken down into detailed technical specifications. Security \ncontrols and information security requirements are also identified through a risk assessment process. This ensures the system design \nincorporates adequate security measures to protect data and prevent vulnerabilities.\nDesign System Component Phase: The system's requirements are transformed into detailed specifications for system components. \nThe system's functional, interface, physical, and security requirements are fully defined during this stage. The design may be iterative, \nensuring that both functional and security considerations are revisited and updated.\nBuild System Component Phase: The system is constructed based on the design specifications. Each system component is coded, \ntested, and integrated with the larger system. Security testing is an integral part of this phase to identify and address potential \nvulnerabilities. Documentation for system installation, operations, and maintenance is also created during this phase.\nEvaluate System Readiness Phase: Independent testing is conducted to ensure that the system meets user requirements and security \nstandards. The system undergoes rigorous evaluation to measure performance, security, and overall readiness for deployment. This \nphase determines whether the system is ready to go live or if it requires redevelopment.\nSystem Deployment Phase: The system is deployed to an initial pilot site for further testing and then transitioned to the production \nenvironment. Training for users and administrators is completed in this phase to ensure proper operation of the system. Any remaining \nvulnerabilities identified during pilot testing are addressed before full-scale deployment.\n\nThe company's SDLC ensures that software projects move through well-defined phases, from initial need identification to deployment, with \nan emphasis on security and system readiness at each stage. By following this process, the company ensures the creation of secure, \nfunctional, and reliable software systems.\n3.3 Project Management\nThe sequence and structure of the software development phases depend on the specific project management approach selected for a given \nproject. Different methodologies can influence the way phases are implemented, including how they interact with one another and whether \nthey are completed sequentially or iteratively.\nWaterfall Development: This is a linear, sequential approach where each phase of the SDLC must be completed before moving on to \nthe next. It is often used for projects with well-defined requirements where changes are expected to be minimal during the development \nprocess.\nAgile Development: Agile development is a flexible, iterative approach that allows for continuous feedback and adaptation throughout \nthe project lifecycle. Small, functional increments of the software are developed and delivered in short cycles (sprints), enabling regular \nreview and adjustment.\nIterative Development: Iterative development allows for repeated cycles of development phases. The project moves through multiple \niterations of planning, design, development, and testing, refining the product in each iteration before arriving at the final release.\nStaged Delivery Development: This method focuses on delivering parts of the system incrementally in stages, with each stage \nrepresenting a functional subset of the final system. This approach allows parts of the system to be put into production early, providing \nvalue while subsequent stages are still in development.\nPhase Combination: Depending on the size and complexity of the software development project, some phases may be combined or \nrevisited. For example, in iterative development, multiple cycles of planning, design, development, and testing may occur before the final \nproduct is released.\nThe project management approach selected influences the sequence and flexibility of the development phases. Approaches such as Agile \nand Iterative Development enable more frequent feedback and adjustments, while Waterfall and Staged Delivery offer more structured, \nsequential development paths. By selecting the appropriate project management methodology, the company ensures that software \ndevelopment processes are both efficient and aligned with project needs.\n3.4 Secure System Engineering Principles\nInformation security implications must be considered throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Responsibilities for information \nsecurity must be clearly defined and allocated within the project management framework to ensure that security is embedded in every stage \nof development. The secure engineering principles are categorized into different layers, each with a focus on specific aspects of system \nsecurity.\n3.4.1 Business Layer\nThe Business Layer addresses the high-level requirements and ensures that security aligns with the company's objectives and risk \ntolerance.\nAlignment with Business Objectives: Ensure security measures align with business goals and risk management strategies.\nRisk Management: Identify and assess risks at each stage of the project and ensure that security controls address business-critical \nrisks.\nCompliance with Regulatory Requirements: Implement controls that ensure compliance with industry regulations (e.g., GDPR, \nHIPAA, ISO 27001).\nUser and Access Management: Ensure that access to systems and data is limited to authorized users based on business roles and \nresponsibilities.\n\n3.4.2 Data Layer\nThe Data Layer focuses on securing the data throughout its lifecycle, from creation to disposal.\nData Confidentiality: Protect sensitive data at rest and in transit using encryption methods that meet regulatory requirements (e.g., \nAES-256).\nData Integrity: Ensure that data is protected from unauthorized modification through hashing and integrity checks (e.g., HMAC, digital \nsignatures).\nData Availability: Implement redundancy and backup mechanisms to ensure data remains available in case of failure or disaster.\nData Minimization: Ensure that only necessary data is collected, retained, and processed, reducing exposure to potential data \nbreaches.\n3.4.3 Applications\nThe Application Layer involves designing and developing applications that are resilient to attacks and vulnerabilities.\nSecure Coding Practices: Use secure development practices, such as input validation, output encoding, and adherence to OWASP \nstandards, to prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).\nAuthentication and Authorization: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that \nonly authorized users can access the application.\nPatch Management: Ensure that applications are regularly updated and patched to address newly discovered vulnerabilities and \nthreats.\nApplication Security Testing: Conduct static and dynamic testing (e.g., SAST, DAST) to identify vulnerabilities before production \nrelease.\n3.4.4 Technology\nThe Technology Layer includes the technical infrastructure that supports the application and data, ensuring security at the network, \nsystem, and hardware levels.\nNetwork Security: Implement firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and network segmentation to protect \nagainst unauthorized access and lateral movement of threats.\nEndpoint Protection: Ensure that all endpoints (e.g., workstations, mobile devices) are equipped with security controls, such as anti-\nmalware tools, firewalls, and encryption.\nSecure Configuration: Apply secure configuration settings to operating systems, servers, and network devices, ensuring that default \nconfigurations are hardened.\nMonitoring and Logging: Implement continuous monitoring and logging of system events, network traffic, and application activity to \ndetect and respond to security incidents.\nThe secure system engineering principles aim to embed security across all layers of development, from business alignment to technology \ninfrastructure. By following these principles, the company ensures that information security is integrated into every aspect of system design, \ndevelopment, and operation.\n3.5 SDLC Security Control Guidelines\nThe company's Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process will adhere to robust security controls designed to safeguard information \nsystems and data. These controls will be applied throughout all phases of software development to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and \navailability of systems and data. \nSeparation of Duties: Adequate procedures must be established to ensure that duties related to the creation and approval of source \ndocuments are separated. Personnel assigned to the development/test environment must be different from those assigned to the \nproduction environment, ensuring clear segregation of responsibilities.\nChange Control Standard: All modifications to code or emergency releases must strictly follow the company's established change \ncontrol standard, ensuring proper documentation and approval of all changes before implementation.\n\nSecure Programming Standards: Secure coding practices must be followed in all software development activities to prevent common \nvulnerabilities and security risks. These practices must align with recognized frameworks such as OWASP and SANS.\nSecure Development Environment: The development environment must be designed and secured based on the following:\nData Sensitivity: The sensitivity of data being processed, stored, or transmitted must dictate the level of security in the development \nenvironment.\nCompliance: All internal and external regulatory requirements must be adhered to.\nPersonnel Trustworthiness: Only trusted and authorized personnel should have access to the development environment.\nOutsourcing Considerations: Security measures must account for the degree of outsourcing, if applicable, ensuring that external \nparties comply with the company's security policies.\nEnvironment Segregation: Development, test, and production environments must be clearly segregated to prevent unauthorized \naccess or data leakage between environments.\nAccess Controls: Access to the development environment must be controlled, logged, and monitored.\nChange Monitoring: All changes to the development environment and stored code must be monitored and audited.\nBackups: Data backups must be securely stored at offsite locations to ensure data availability in the event of a disaster.\nData Movement: Control over data movement to and from the development environment must be established to prevent \nunauthorized access or disclosure.\nThreat Modeling and Incident Reviews: Threat modeling must be conducted as part of the system design to identify and mitigate \npotential risks. Reviews of security incidents and contingency planning must also be in place to address vulnerabilities based on the \noperational environment.\nSecurity Vulnerabilities and Threat Prevention: All software deployed on corporate or hosted infrastructure must be designed to \nprevent security issues, including those outlined in OWASP and SANS. Static application security testing (SAST) or equivalent tools \nmust be used to detect vulnerabilities during the development process.\nCode Reviews: All code changes must undergo review by individuals other than the originating developer, with an emphasis on secure \ncoding practices. Reviews must be conducted by personnel knowledgeable in code review techniques and secure programming.\nOverrides and Approvals: Overrides of edit checks, approvals, and changes to confirmed transactions must be properly documented, \nauthorized, and reviewed.\nDevelopment and Production Environment Separation: Application development activities must be separated from production and \ntest environments, with enforced access controls. The extent of separation should be appropriate to the risk associated with the business \napplication and aligned with contractual requirements. Separation between production, development, and test environments should be \nevaluated regularly, and controls must be established to secure these environments.\nTest Environment Configuration: Test environments must mirror production environments as closely as possible to ensure accurate \ntesting outcomes and identify potential issues.\nChange Control in Production: All changes to production environments must adhere to the company's change control procedures. \nHuman approval from authorized individuals must be obtained for all changes. Automated updates should be disallowed without prior \napproval, and approval mechanisms must be enforced through automated systems wherever feasible (e.g., branch protection settings \non production code repositories).\nThe company's SDLC security controls are designed to ensure a secure, compliant, and well-managed development process. By following \nthese guidelines, the company safeguards its systems and data throughout the entire software development lifecycle.\n3.6 Secure Software Development Training and Practices\nThe company requires all personnel involved in supporting or writing bespoke or custom software to complete annual security training that \nfocuses on secure coding practices. This is particularly important for individuals involved in developing or supporting internet-facing \napplications, where specific threats related to online vulnerabilities are more prevalent.\nAnnual Security Training: All individuals writing or supporting custom software must complete secure coding training annually. This \ntraining must be completed prior to engaging in any software development or support activities. The training will include the most recent \nOWASP secure development principles and awareness of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.\n\nSpecialized Internet Threat Training: For those supporting or writing internet-facing applications, additional training must cover security \nthreats that are specific to the web, including techniques for defending against common internet-based attacks.\nAccount and Credential Security: Custom accounts, user IDs, and passwords must be removed from all applications before they are \ndeployed or released to customers to avoid potential backdoor vulnerabilities.\nProhibition on Production Data in Testing: Production data should not be used in development or test environments. Testing must be \nconducted with anonymized or synthetic data to prevent unauthorized exposure of sensitive information.\nProduction Quality Controls in Test Systems: Security controls applied to the production environment must be mirrored in test \nenvironments to ensure consistency. The test environment should match the production environment as closely as possible to simulate \nreal-world conditions while maintaining security.\nQuality Assurance (QA) Testing: QA processes prior to the release of new features must include thorough testing of user input \nconstraints. This testing must cover edge and boundary cases to identify potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited through \nunexpected user behavior.\nThe company mandates comprehensive secure coding training and practices to ensure that software development and support activities \nadhere to the highest standards of security. By focusing on secure development principles, mirroring production controls, and emphasizing \nrigorous QA testing, the company minimizes the risk of vulnerabilities in its applications.\n3.7 Production Data Use in Testing\nIn situations where production data must be used for testing purposes, stringent controls must be followed to ensure the confidentiality, \nintegrity, and security of the data. The following requirements outline the process for safely handling production data during testing:\nApproval Requirement: The Information Resource Owner must provide explicit approval before production data can be used in any \ntesting environment.\nData Anonymization: Wherever possible, production data should be tokenized, anonymized, removed, or de-identified to avoid \nexposing sensitive information during the testing process.\nSeparation of Data: Testing and parallel runs must use a separate copy of production data, and the test location must meet security \nstandards (e.g., loading confidential production data onto unsecured devices such as laptops is prohibited).\nRestricted Handling: Production data must not be extracted, handled, or used in a way that exposes it to unauthorized access. Data \nhandling must follow strict protocols to prevent unauthorized disclosure.\nAccess Control: Only personnel with a documented business need may access production data for testing, and access must follow the \nsame control procedures as those used in operational environments.\nAuthorization for Test Data: Each instance of copying operational data to a test environment must receive separate authorization, \nensuring that only necessary data is transferred.\nAudit Logging: All instances of copying production data into a test environment must be logged, and audit trails must be maintained for \nfuture review.\nLimited Access: Production data must be restricted to users with a documented business need, and only the necessary information \nshould be accessible to those users. The access control process must ensure that only authorized personnel are permitted to interact \nwith the data.\nData Erasure: Production data used for testing purposes must be securely erased once testing is complete to prevent any further \naccess or exposure.\nTest Data Removal: All test data and user accounts created during the testing phase must be removed prior to the system's deployment \ninto a production environment.\nData Encryption: Any Restricted or Protected Information used in testing must be encrypted according to the company's Encryption \nStandard, both while at rest and during transit.\nUsing production data for testing purposes must be strictly controlled. Approval from the Information Resource Owner is required, and data \nmust be anonymized or tokenized wherever feasible. Only authorized personnel can access production data, and all data transfers must be \nlogged for auditing. Data must be securely erased upon completion of testing, ensuring sensitive information remains protected.\n\n3.8 Outsourced Production Security Requirements\nWhen production is outsourced, the company must implement stringent controls across the entire external supply chain. These controls are \ndesigned to ensure compliance with security, quality, and contractual obligations, in conjunction with the requirements outlined in the Vendor \nManagement Policy.\nLicensing and Intellectual Property: Licensing arrangements, code ownership, and intellectual property rights related to outsourced \ncontent must be clearly defined and agreed upon. The company retains ownership of its intellectual property and must ensure all \nlicensing agreements are valid and secure.\nSecure Development Requirements: The company must establish contractual requirements for secure design, coding, and testing \npractices with external developers. This includes ensuring all security protocols are adhered to during development.\nThreat Model Provision: The company must provide the approved threat model to external developers to ensure they are aware of all \nsecurity considerations and risks associated with the project.\nAcceptance Testing: All deliverables must undergo thorough acceptance testing for quality, accuracy, and security. This testing ensures \nthe product meets the company's functional and security requirements.\nSecurity Thresholds: External developers must provide evidence that security thresholds have been applied to establish minimum \nacceptable levels of security and privacy quality for the deliverables.\nTesting for Malicious Content: Sufficient testing must be conducted to ensure the deliverables are free from both intentional and \nunintentional malicious content.

All \naccess is regulated using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), adhering to the Principle of Least Privilege to ensure that each user has \nonly the necessary access required to perform their duties.\nMinimum Necessary Access: User access to systems is determined by job classification, ensuring that only the minimum necessary \nlevel of access is granted.\nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC): The assignment of user rights and access to systems is regulated by the RBAC method, \nensuring that access levels align with user roles and responsibilities.\nSegregation of Duties: The need for segregation of duties is considered when assigning user rights, preventing potential conflicts of \ninterest or undue concentration of authority.\nFormal Documentation and Authorization: All access requests, including the addition, deletion, and modification of user IDs, \nauthentication factors, and other identifying objects, must be documented and formally authorized.\nAccess Request Process: Workforce members initiate access requests by creating an issue in the company's ticketing system, \ndetailing the type of access needed.\nIdentity Verification: User identities must be verified in person whenever possible before granting access to new accounts. For remote \nemployees, verification may be conducted over the phone, with the method of verification recorded in the ticketing system.\nAuthorization by Security Officer: The Security Officer is responsible for granting or rejecting access based on the employee's role \nand job classification. If additional access is required, the requester must provide a valid reason as part of the request.\nReview and Documentation: If an access request is rejected, it must go through a further review process, with detailed documentation. \nApproved requests are marked as complete and include all pertinent notes.\nAccess to the company's systems is carefully regulated through RBAC, ensuring that users are granted only the minimum necessary access \nfor their roles. Formal documentation and identity verification are required, with reviews conducted for additional access requests to \nmaintain security and accountability.\n3.2 Access Reviews\nUser access to company systems and services will be subject to periodic reviews to ensure that accounts, including third-party or vendor \naccounts, are appropriately assigned based on job functions. These reviews help maintain compliance with the Principle of Least Privilege \nand ensure access rights are adjusted as needed.\nQuarterly Access Reviews: Management will conduct formal access reviews at least once every quarter to verify that the roles and \npermissions associated with all user accounts, including third-party or vendor accounts, are still appropriate.\nJob Function Alignment: Access reviews focus on ensuring that user roles and permissions are aligned with current job functions and \nthat no excess or unauthorized access exists.\nManagement Authorization: During the access review, management is responsible for confirming that user accounts are in compliance \nwith established authorization requirements.\nQuarterly access reviews ensure that user accounts, including third-party and vendor accounts, remain aligned with job responsibilities, \npreventing unnecessary or unauthorized access to sensitive systems. These reviews are a key part of the company's efforts to maintain \nappropriate security controls.\n3.3 User Identification and Authentication\nTo ensure the security of system components, users and administrators must be authenticated using at least one authentication factor. This \nprocess is critical to safeguarding the company's systems and sensitive information.\nAuthentication Factors: Access will require at least one of the following:\nSomething you know, such as a password or passphrase.\n\nSomething you have, such as a token device or smart card.\nSomething you are, such as a biometric element.\nUnique Login Credentials: Each user will have a unique login ID and password, ensuring individual accountability.\nAuthentication Requirements: Single sign-on (SSO) and minimum password requirements will be enforced based on the company's \nPassword Policy. Passwords will never be displayed, transmitted, or stored in plain text.\nDefault Accounts: Default accounts on all production systems, including root, will be deleted, disabled, or restricted to a limited number \nof authorized administrators. These accounts will only be used under exceptional circumstances with documented business justification \nand management approval.\nShared Accounts: The use of group, shared, or generic accounts is prohibited unless absolutely necessary and approved by \nmanagement. Individual user identity must be confirmed before access is granted, and all actions must be traceable to a specific user.\nAuthentication Tokens: Physical or logical tokens, smart cards, or certificates will be assigned to individual users and cannot be \nshared. Additional controls, such as PINs or biometric data, will ensure only authorized users can access accounts.\nAutomated Log-on: Automated log-on configurations, other than the company's approved password management tools, are prohibited \nfrom storing user passwords or bypassing password entry on workstations or production systems.\nThe company enforces strict identification and authentication policies, requiring the use of unique credentials, secure authentication factors, \nand limiting access to default and shared accounts. These measures ensure accountability and safeguard access to critical systems.\n3.4 Multi-factor Authentication\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all system access where technically feasible, providing an additional layer of security for \nusers, administrators, and third parties.\nUse of MFA: MFA will be enforced to enhance security by requiring multiple types of authentication for access to systems.\nSystem Configuration: Systems using MFA must:\nPrevent replay attacks through secure token generation and validation processes.\nRequire at least two distinct types of authentication factors (e.g., something you know, something you have, or something you are).\nRestrict any bypassing of MFA by users, including administrative users, unless specifically documented and approved by \nmanagement on an exception basis, for a limited time period.\nRemote Access: MFA is mandatory for all remote access to the company's network, including access by users, administrators, and \nthird-party vendors. This ensures that remote connections are secure and access is only granted to authenticated users.\nMulti-factor authentication is essential to securing system access, particularly for remote access scenarios. By requiring multiple \nauthentication factors and preventing unauthorized bypassing, the company maintains a high level of security for all users and systems.\n3.5 Automated Logoffs\nAutomated logoffs are implemented to secure devices and systems by minimizing unauthorized access due to inactivity.\nScreen Lock Timeout: Company-issued devices and any bring-your-own or third-party devices connected to company systems will \nenforce a screensaver lock with a timeout of 15 minutes or less of inactivity. This ensures that devices are locked when not actively in \nuse, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\nSystem Logoff: Where technically feasible, the company's applications and systems will automatically log users out after 15 minutes of \ninactivity or upon closure of the system or internet browser. This configuration secures the system by terminating sessions that may \notherwise remain vulnerable to unauthorized access.\nAutomated logoffs are an important control for ensuring security, by locking or logging out inactive sessions on both devices and systems. \nThese measures protect sensitive data by ensuring that unattended devices and open sessions are quickly secured.\n\n3.6 Third-Party Access\nThird-party access to the company's systems is strictly controlled to ensure security and accountability when external entities access critical \nsystem components.\nTime-Limited Access: Accounts provided to third parties for system access, support, or maintenance will be enabled only for the \nrequired time period. Access will be granted based on documented approval from management and will be promptly disabled once the \nspecific task is completed.\nMonitoring of Remote Access: All third-party remote access will be continuously monitored by company personnel for any signs of \nunauthorized or unexpected activity. Monitoring will include real-time oversight and logging of access events to ensure accountability and \ndetect potential security risks.\nAuthorization and Documentation: All third-party access must be authorized by management, with clear documentation outlining the \npurpose, duration, and scope of access. No third-party access will be granted without proper authorization.\nThird-party access is restricted and closely monitored to ensure that external entities are granted system access only when necessary, with \nappropriate safeguards in place to detect and address any unauthorized activity.\n3.7 Application and System Accounts\nApplication and system accounts will be managed to ensure access is limited to only what is necessary for system operability and will follow \nstrict guidelines for security.\nProvisioning of Accounts: All application and system accounts will be provisioned based on documented authorization from \nmanagement. Access privileges will be limited to only what is necessary for the application or system to function effectively, \nminimizing unnecessary access.\nInteractive Login Management: \nPrevention of Interactive Use: Interactive login through system or application accounts will be prevented unless specifically \nrequired for an exceptional circumstance. \nTime-Limited Access: If interactive access is required, it will be restricted to the necessary timeframe to complete the required \ntask. \nBusiness Justification: A documented business justification must accompany any request for interactive login, explaining why \nsuch access is necessary.\nManagement Approval: Interactive use must be explicitly approved by management, ensuring that only authorized personnel can \nuse the account.\nAccountability: Every action taken using an interactive account must be attributable to an individual user. Individual user identity \nwill be confirmed before access is granted.\nApplication and system accounts will be tightly controlled to ensure that they are only used for necessary system operations, with interactive \naccess limited to exceptional circumstances and approved by management. Every action must be linked to an identifiable user to maintain \naccountability.\n3.8 Use of Utility Programs\nAccess to utility programs that have the potential to bypass normal operating system or application controls will be restricted to authorized \npersonnel to maintain the security and integrity of the company's systems.\nRestricted Access to Utility Programs: Only authorized system administrators will have access to manage utility programs such as \nanti-virus consoles, diagnostic tools, patching software, backup utilities, and network tools. These programs will be restricted from \ngeneral user access due to their ability to bypass normal security controls.\nPrivileged Utility Access Control: \nStandard User Restrictions: Standard users will be restricted from accessing privileged utilities or making modifications to their \nconfigurations.\n\nAuthentication and Access Controls: Strict authentication mechanisms and access controls will be implemented to ensure only \nauthorized administrators can access or modify utility programs, preventing unauthorized changes to the system.\nUtility programs with the ability to bypass security controls will be strictly restricted to authorized system administrators, with standard users \ndenied access. This ensures the integrity of system configurations and limits unauthorized access to privileged tools.\n3.9 Employee Termination/Offboarding Procedures\nThe company will revoke system and physical access for terminated users (employees, third parties, vendors, and other personnel) \npromptly to safeguard its systems and data.\nAccess Revocation: System and physical access will be revoked within one business day of the termination date. This applies to all \nterminated users including employees, vendors, and third parties.\nTermination Checklist and Notification:\nThe HR/People department, along with the users and their supervisors, are responsible for notifying system administrators of \nupcoming separations and ensuring the completion of a \"Termination Checklist.\"\nSystem administrators will terminate access rights within the established service level agreements (SLAs) upon notification of \ntermination or separation.\nAsset Return Tracking: \nThe HR/People department (or designated department) will track the return of all electronic and physical assets, including \nlaptops, files, access mechanisms (such as keys, access cards, badges, and multi-factor authentication tokens) as part of the \noffboarding process.\nIncident-Based Access Termination:\nSystem administrators will terminate a user's access if there is evidence or suspicion that:\nThe user has been misusing their access rights.\nA user's password has been compromised. If the user is not responsible for the password compromise, a new password may \nbe provided.\nUpon termination, the company ensures that access to systems and physical locations is revoked within one business day, while the \nHR/People department oversees asset returns and the completion of termination procedures. Access is also terminated if there is misuse or \nevidence of a password compromise.\n3.10 Disabling Accounts: High-Risk Users\nThe company will disable accounts of users deemed to pose a high risk to its systems and data. Accounts will be disabled for a specified \nperiod depending on the risk severity.\nUser intends to sell company information to a competitor Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser accesses unauthorized sensitive data without a business \nneed \nImmediately                 3 weeks                     \nUser deliberately attempts to bypass security controls Immediately                 6 weeks                     \nUser leaks confidential information to external parties Immediately                 2 months                    \nUser violates policy by sharing credentials Immediately                 2 weeks                     \nUser installs unauthorized software or malware Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser repeatedly fails to comply with security procedures Immediately                 4 weeks                     \nUser uses company resources for illegal activities Immediately                 Permanent Disablement       \nRiskTime Period to DisableDuration of Disablement\n\nHigh-risk accounts will be disabled promptly based on the nature of the risk and the severity of the violation.

Records of findings must be retained for at least 2 years.\nThe scanning and identification of Checkstep's system vulnerabilities is performed by:\n•Automated Drata security agent installed on all employees' machines.\n•AWS Inspector for infrastructure and AWS ECR vulnerability scanner for images\nAdditionally, periodic security scans of Checkstep systems are done using a combination of external open-source and\ncommercial vulnerability testing tools, including but not limited to:\n•Container Analysis performs vulnerability scans on images in artifact registry\n•Secrets scanning in the code base\n•Dependency scanning automatically finds security vulnerabilities in software dependencies. For example,\nGitLab dependency scanning is interopable with Python package managers using a tool called Gemnasium.\nUser Interface applications using JavaScript can have dependencies scanned using a tool such as Retire.js\nPenetration Testing\nInternal penetration tests are done regularly as the product is being developed by Checkstep security team utilising\nautomated and manual processes. Penetration testing is performed by a certified penetration tester from an independent\nthird party at least once every two years or upon Checkstep's client request, whichever comes sooner.\nFindings from a vulnerability scan and/or penetration test are analyzed by the Security Officer, together with IT and\nEngineering as needed, and reported through the process defined in the next section.\nSecurity Findings Reporting, Tracking and Remediation\nCheckstep follows a simple vulnerability tracking process using Jira.

facilities, infrastructure, and sensitive data based on a risk-\nbased approach and implemented where feasible. \nAccess Restriction: Physical access to the company's secure facilities, such as server rooms and critical infrastructure, is restricted to \nauthorized personnel only. In remote locations, employees are responsible for securing access to company resources through digital \nmeans, such as VPNs and secure login systems.\nEmployee Identification: In secure controlled facilities, employees are required to wear identification badges to distinguish themselves \nas authorized personnel. In remote environments, this control may not be applicable but should be supplemented by other identity \nverification methods where necessary.\nVisitor Management: Visitors and vendors must be escorted by an authorized employee at all times while on company premises. Visitor \naccess may not be applicable in remote locations, but employees are required to ensure the confidentiality and security of any sensitive \ninformation.\nIncident Reporting: All workforce members are responsible for reporting unauthorized visitors or access attempts to company facilities \nor systems. This includes both physical locations and remote work environments. Reporting should be immediate to the Security Officer \nor Facility Manager.\nRecord-Keeping: It is recommended to retain a detailed record of each physical access, including visits, maintenance, and repairs \nwhere feasible.\nGiven the remote nature of many locations, physical controls will be implemented flexibly based on an assessment of the risks involved in \neach environment.\n3.2 Access Requirements\nPhysical access to secure facilities is managed through badge readers, smart locks, and physical keys. In environments where these \ncontrols are not applicable, such as coworking spaces, alternative security measures based on risk assessments will be applied.\nBadge and Key Management: Access to the company's badge and key systems is restricted to authorized personnel based on a need-\nto-know basis. Workforce members must report lost or stolen keys or badges immediately to their manager, and the Facility Manager \nmust re-provision access or change locks within 7 days.\nRestricted Areas: Secure areas, such as server rooms, must be locked when unattended, and access is granted only to authorized \nemployees. In remote or coworking environments, employees must ensure their devices and sensitive information are secured.\nVisitor Controls: Visitors must sign a log upon entering secure facilities, indicating the date, time, purpose, and point of contact. Visitor \nlogs must be kept for at least 3 months. In remote environments, visitor controls may not be applicable but should be replaced by strong \ndigital access controls.\nLoading and Delivery Areas: Access to loading and delivery areas is restricted to authorized personnel, and shipments should be \ninspected according to Asset Management procedures. In remote locations, this control may not be necessary but should be considered \nif the location handles sensitive assets.\n3.3 Maintenance and Monitoring\nContinuous monitoring and maintenance of physical security systems are crucial for protecting the company's assets. These requirements \napply primarily to formal company locations, while remote work environments may not require such stringent controls.\nMany of the company's operations take place either in its own offices or remotely, including at home, in cafes, or coworking spaces. \nThe company's own offices may also be considered as remote locations in certain contexts.\nAs a result, certain physical security controls, such as badge systems or visitor logs, may not be applicable to all environments. \nSecurity measures will be applied based on a risk-based approach and implemented where feasible. The specific controls \nimplemented will vary depending on the location and the nature of the activities being conducted there.\n\nMaintenance of Security Equipment: Any repairs or maintenance to physical security equipment, including locks, cameras, and access \ncontrol systems, must be documented, with records retained for at least seven years.\nCCTV Monitoring: Secure areas must be monitored by CCTV, with recordings stored for at least 3 months. For remote locations, \nemployees are responsible for ensuring security through digital means, such as monitoring login activity and using endpoint security \nmeasures.\nAlarm Systems: Alarm systems must be installed in critical areas and tested regularly. In remote work environments, employees should \nensure the security of their workspace, devices, and data through encryption and secure access controls.\n3.4 Workstation Security\nWorkstation security is essential to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive company data. In formal facilities, workstations are protected \nby physical and technical safeguards, while in remote locations, employees must follow strict digital security measures.\nAccess to Workstations: Only authorized employees may access company-owned workstations, and these devices must be used \nsolely for business purposes. Workstations must be locked or logged off when left unattended.\nPhysical Safeguards: In shared or open workspaces, workstations must be positioned to prevent unauthorized viewing of sensitive \ninformation. Employees should use privacy filters or position screens away from public view.\nPortable Device Security: Laptops and other portable devices containing sensitive information must be secured when left unattended, \nusing cable locks or locked storage. Employees in remote environments must also adhere to the company's Encryption Policy.\n3.5 Visitor and Vendor Management\nVisitor and vendor access to company facilities must be tightly controlled, though these measures may not be applicable in remote work \nenvironments.\nEscort Requirement: Visitors and vendors must be escorted by an authorized company employee while on the premises. Remote \nenvironments, such as cafes, may not have the need for physical escorts, but sensitive data must be protected.\nVisitor Badges: Visitors in formal company locations must wear badges that distinguish them from employees. These badges must be \nreturned when leaving the facility.\nVisitor Logs: Logs documenting visitor access, including date, time, and purpose, must be maintained for at least 3 months. In remote \nenvironments, visitor logs may not apply, but employees must ensure secure access to any shared devices or data.\n3.6 Data Center and Building Standards\nThe company does not maintain its own data centers and instead relies on cloud infrastructure providers such as AWS and Azure. However, \nany physical infrastructure under the company's control must adhere to high security standards.\nSecurity Perimeters: Secure perimeters must be established around areas containing critical data or infrastructure. Entry points should \nbe protected with access controls and monitored by surveillance cameras.\nCCTV Monitoring: Critical areas must be monitored by CCTV, and recordings must be kept for at least 3 months.\nBackup Power: Backup power supplies, such as UPS systems, must be available for critical infrastructure to ensure continuous \noperations during power outages.\nEmergency Power Shut-off: Emergency power shut-off switches must be located near exits in critical equipment rooms to allow for \nrapid shutdown during emergencies.\n3.7 Enforcement of Facility Access Policies\nTo ensure compliance with security policies, violations of these controls will result in investigation and potential disciplinary actions.\nIncident Reporting: Employees, visitors, and vendors must report any violations of physical security policies to their manager or the \nSecurity Officer immediately.\n\nDisciplinary Actions: Employees found violating these policies may face disciplinary actions, up to and including termination. Visitors \nand vendors may have their access privileges revoked.\nIn remote environments, security measures may be adapted based on risk assessments, but all employees are responsible for safeguarding \ncompany data and resources. Non-compliance will be investigated and addressed accordingly.\n4 Document Administration\n4.1 Ownership and Review\n  \n4.2 Monitoring and Enforcement\n4.3 Related Documents\n4.3.1 Internal documents\nInformation Security Policy \nInformation Security Organization Policy\n4.4 Approvals\n4.5 Revision History\nFollow the link for details of revisions. \nThe Document Owner owns this Document and is responsible for reviewing the Document for updates annually, or following any major \nchanges to Squirro AG's compliance environment.

systems follow a consistent and repeatable \nSoftware Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process. This process will integrate information security at every stage to protect assets and \nmaintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\nStandardized Phases: Each software development project must follow defined SDLC phases: Determine System Need, Define System \nRequirements, Design System Components, Build System Components, Evaluate System Readiness, and System Deployment.\nIterative Cycles: Depending on the project management approach (Waterfall, Agile, Iterative), some SDLC phases can be combined or \niterated multiple times.\nSecure Engineering Principles: Security principles for business, data, application, and technology layers must be applied throughout \nthe SDLC to address risks identified via the company's information security risk assessments.\nThe company's SDLC ensures software development follows secure, standardized processes with integrated security measures at every \nstage, aligned with risk management strategies.\n3.2 Software Development Phases\nThe company's software development life cycle (SDLC) follows a structured approach consisting of several key phases, ensuring that both \nfunctional and security requirements are addressed at each step.\nDetermine System Need Phase: The initial phase where the system need is identified. During this phase, the business or technical \nneed for the system is evaluated, and resources are committed to address the requirement. This phase involves the identification of risks \nand opportunities for improving business processes through technology solutions.\nDefine System Requirements Phase: In this phase, user requirements are broken down into detailed technical specifications. Security \ncontrols and information security requirements are also identified through a risk assessment process. This ensures the system design \nincorporates adequate security measures to protect data and prevent vulnerabilities.\nDesign System Component Phase: The system's requirements are transformed into detailed specifications for system components. \nThe system's functional, interface, physical, and security requirements are fully defined during this stage. The design may be iterative, \nensuring that both functional and security considerations are revisited and updated.\nBuild System Component Phase: The system is constructed based on the design specifications. Each system component is coded, \ntested, and integrated with the larger system. Security testing is an integral part of this phase to identify and address potential \nvulnerabilities. Documentation for system installation, operations, and maintenance is also created during this phase.\nEvaluate System Readiness Phase: Independent testing is conducted to ensure that the system meets user requirements and security \nstandards. The system undergoes rigorous evaluation to measure performance, security, and overall readiness for deployment. This \nphase determines whether the system is ready to go live or if it requires redevelopment.\nSystem Deployment Phase: The system is deployed to an initial pilot site for further testing and then transitioned to the production \nenvironment. Training for users and administrators is completed in this phase to ensure proper operation of the system. Any remaining \nvulnerabilities identified during pilot testing are addressed before full-scale deployment.\n\nThe company's SDLC ensures that software projects move through well-defined phases, from initial need identification to deployment, with \nan emphasis on security and system readiness at each stage. By following this process, the company ensures the creation of secure, \nfunctional, and reliable software systems.\n3.3 Project Management\nThe sequence and structure of the software development phases depend on the specific project management approach selected for a given \nproject. Different methodologies can influence the way phases are implemented, including how they interact with one another and whether \nthey are completed sequentially or iteratively.\nWaterfall Development: This is a linear, sequential approach where each phase of the SDLC must be completed before moving on to \nthe next. It is often used for projects with well-defined requirements where changes are expected to be minimal during the development \nprocess.\nAgile Development: Agile development is a flexible, iterative approach that allows for continuous feedback and adaptation throughout \nthe project lifecycle. Small, functional increments of the software are developed and delivered in short cycles (sprints), enabling regular \nreview and adjustment.\nIterative Development: Iterative development allows for repeated cycles of development phases. The project moves through multiple \niterations of planning, design, development, and testing, refining the product in each iteration before arriving at the final release.\nStaged Delivery Development: This method focuses on delivering parts of the system incrementally in stages, with each stage \nrepresenting a functional subset of the final system. This approach allows parts of the system to be put into production early, providing \nvalue while subsequent stages are still in development.\nPhase Combination: Depending on the size and complexity of the software development project, some phases may be combined or \nrevisited. For example, in iterative development, multiple cycles of planning, design, development, and testing may occur before the final \nproduct is released.\nThe project management approach selected influences the sequence and flexibility of the development phases. Approaches such as Agile \nand Iterative Development enable more frequent feedback and adjustments, while Waterfall and Staged Delivery offer more structured, \nsequential development paths. By selecting the appropriate project management methodology, the company ensures that software \ndevelopment processes are both efficient and aligned with project needs.\n3.4 Secure System Engineering Principles\nInformation security implications must be considered throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Responsibilities for information \nsecurity must be clearly defined and allocated within the project management framework to ensure that security is embedded in every stage \nof development. The secure engineering principles are categorized into different layers, each with a focus on specific aspects of system \nsecurity.\n3.4.1 Business Layer\nThe Business Layer addresses the high-level requirements and ensures that security aligns with the company's objectives and risk \ntolerance.\nAlignment with Business Objectives: Ensure security measures align with business goals and risk management strategies.\nRisk Management: Identify and assess risks at each stage of the project and ensure that security controls address business-critical \nrisks.\nCompliance with Regulatory Requirements: Implement controls that ensure compliance with industry regulations (e.g., GDPR, \nHIPAA, ISO 27001).\nUser and Access Management: Ensure that access to systems and data is limited to authorized users based on business roles and \nresponsibilities.\n\n3.4.2 Data Layer\nThe Data Layer focuses on securing the data throughout its lifecycle, from creation to disposal.\nData Confidentiality: Protect sensitive data at rest and in transit using encryption methods that meet regulatory requirements (e.g., \nAES-256).\nData Integrity: Ensure that data is protected from unauthorized modification through hashing and integrity checks (e.g., HMAC, digital \nsignatures).\nData Availability: Implement redundancy and backup mechanisms to ensure data remains available in case of failure or disaster.\nData Minimization: Ensure that only necessary data is collected, retained, and processed, reducing exposure to potential data \nbreaches.\n3.4.3 Applications\nThe Application Layer involves designing and developing applications that are resilient to attacks and vulnerabilities.\nSecure Coding Practices: Use secure development practices, such as input validation, output encoding, and adherence to OWASP \nstandards, to prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).\nAuthentication and Authorization: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that \nonly authorized users can access the application.\nPatch Management: Ensure that applications are regularly updated and patched to address newly discovered vulnerabilities and \nthreats.\nApplication Security Testing: Conduct static and dynamic testing (e.g., SAST, DAST) to identify vulnerabilities before production \nrelease.\n3.4.4 Technology\nThe Technology Layer includes the technical infrastructure that supports the application and data, ensuring security at the network, \nsystem, and hardware levels.\nNetwork Security: Implement firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and network segmentation to protect \nagainst unauthorized access and lateral movement of threats.\nEndpoint Protection: Ensure that all endpoints (e.g., workstations, mobile devices) are equipped with security controls, such as anti-\nmalware tools, firewalls, and encryption.\nSecure Configuration: Apply secure configuration settings to operating systems, servers, and network devices, ensuring that default \nconfigurations are hardened.\nMonitoring and Logging: Implement continuous monitoring and logging of system events, network traffic, and application activity to \ndetect and respond to security incidents.\nThe secure system engineering principles aim to embed security across all layers of development, from business alignment to technology \ninfrastructure. By following these principles, the company ensures that information security is integrated into every aspect of system design, \ndevelopment, and operation.\n3.5 SDLC Security Control Guidelines\nThe company's Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process will adhere to robust security controls designed to safeguard information \nsystems and data. These controls will be applied throughout all phases of software development to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and \navailability of systems and data. \nSeparation of Duties: Adequate procedures must be established to ensure that duties related to the creation and approval of source \ndocuments are separated. Personnel assigned to the development/test environment must be different from those assigned to the \nproduction environment, ensuring clear segregation of responsibilities.\nChange Control Standard: All modifications to code or emergency releases must strictly follow the company's established change \ncontrol standard, ensuring proper documentation and approval of all changes before implementation.\n\nSecure Programming Standards: Secure coding practices must be followed in all software development activities to prevent common \nvulnerabilities and security risks.

These \nlogs must provide sufficient detail to answer the following questions:\nWhat activity was performed?\nWho performed the activity?\nWhere, when, and how was it performed (including the tools used)?\nWhat was the status, outcome, or result of the activity?\nBy ensuring that logs capture this information, the company enhances its ability to monitor, review, and respond to security events, ensuring \nthe integrity and security of its systems.\n3.2 Logged Activities\nLog records must be created for the following activities:\n\nSensitive Information Access:\nAttempts to create, read, update, or delete sensitive information, including confidential authentication data such as passwords.\nNetwork Connections:\nInitiating or accepting a network connection.\nUser Authentication and Authorization:\nUser login and logout, as well as any changes to access rights.\nInvalid Logical Access Attempts:\nAll unauthorized or failed logical access attempts.\nAdministrative Actions:\nAll actions performed by individuals with administrative or elevated privileges.\nAttempts to grant, modify, or revoke access rights (e.g., adding a new user or group, changing user privilege levels, modifying file or \ndatabase permissions).\nChanges to firewall rules, user privileges, and database object permissions.\nModifications of administrative access, including user password changes and elevation of privileges.\nAudit Log Access:\nAll access to audit logs, including actions such as starting, stopping, or pausing audit logs.\nSystem-Level Changes:\nCreation and deletion of system-level objects.\nChanges in system, network, or services configuration, including the installation of software patches, updates, or other installed \nsoftware modifications.\nSystem Events:\nApplication and process events, such as startup, shutdown, or restart.\nApplication process failure, abnormal termination, or resource exhaustion (e.g., CPU, memory, network bandwidth, disk space).\nFailures of critical services (e.g., DHCP, DNS), hardware faults, or hardware malfunctions.\nDetection of Suspicious/Malicious Activity:\nDetection and logging of potential security threats, including alerts from intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention \nsystems (IPS), web application firewalls, anti-malware systems, or anti-spyware tools.\nBy capturing these logged activities, the company ensures full visibility into system operations and enhances the ability to respond to \npotential security incidents or system malfunctions.\n3.3 Log Elements\nEach log must identify or contain the following elements to ensure thorough audit trails and log correlation where feasible (content may \ndepend on system):\nType of Action      The specific action performed, such as authorize, create, read, update, delete, or network connection \ninitiation. Includes whether the action was successful or failed. \nSubsystem           The process or transaction name responsible for performing the action. Examples include a system \nservice or application transaction. \nIdentifiers         Identifying information for the subject requesting the action, such as user name, computer name, IP \naddress, MAC address. These identifiers should be standardized for easy correlation. \nObject of Action    Identifies what the action was performed on, such as file names accessed, records from a database, or \nspecific network resources affected. \nElementDescription\n\nThis structured approach ensures that logs provide comprehensive visibility into system activities, enabling effective monitoring, auditing, \nand security investigations.\n3.4 Clock Synchronization\nTo ensure the accuracy of system logs, all system clocks must be synchronized using time-synchronization technology. The following \nrequirements are mandatory for maintaining the integrity and consistency of audit logs:\nTime Source: Logs must rely on accurate time sources, either International Atomic Time (TAI) or Coordinated Universal Time \n(UTC), to ensure uniformity across systems.\nNetwork Time Protocol (NTP): All servers and critical infrastructure must use NTP to synchronize their clocks with a central time server. \nThis ensures that the timestamps in audit logs are consistent across the environment.\nTime Synchronization Settings:\nAccess Control: Time synchronization settings will be restricted to authorized personnel only. Changes to the time settings must be \nlimited to those with a business need and appropriate permissions.\nLogging Changes: Any modification to time settings on critical systems must be logged, including details of the personnel making \nthe change and the reason for it.\nMonitoring: System logs must be continuously monitored to ensure that no unauthorized or unintended changes to the time settings \noccur. Any detected discrepancies will be flagged and reviewed.\nAuditing and Review: Regular reviews of time synchronization settings and logs will be conducted to detect any drift or misalignment in \ntime stamps, ensuring the accuracy of all logged events.\nThis synchronization mechanism helps ensure that all log entries are recorded with accurate and consistent timestamps, which is essential \nfor auditing, investigations, and compliance reporting.\n3.5 Protection of Audit Logs\nTo ensure the integrity and security of audit logs, the following controls will be implemented to safeguard logs from tampering by individuals \nwith elevated access or unauthorized users:\nAccess Control:\nRestricted Access: Read access to audit logs will be strictly limited to personnel with a job-related need. Only authorized \nindividuals responsible for monitoring or auditing system activity will be granted this access.\nAdministrator Restrictions: System administrators will be restricted from erasing, deactivating, or modifying logs of their own \nactivities if possible. This ensures transparency and accountability for administrative actions.\nBackup:\nCentralized Backup: All audit log files, including those related to external-facing technologies, will be backed up to a secure, \ncentralized internal log server or other secure media. These backups will be stored outside the direct control of system \nadministrators to prevent manipulation.\nRedundancy and Availability: Logs must be backed up on a regular basis, with redundancy measures in place to ensure log \navailability during recovery from failures or security incidents.\nBefore/After Values When applicable and feasible, records the before and after values of data elements that are updated as \npart of the action. \nDate and Time       The exact date and time the action was performed, including relevant time-zone information. For \nconsistency, logs should use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) when possible. \nAccess Control Outcome Whether the action was allowed or denied by the system's access control mechanisms. \nAccess Control Reason  In the event the action is denied, logs should contain descriptions or reason codes explaining why it \nwas blocked. \n\nFile Integrity Monitoring:\nChange Detection: A file integrity monitoring (FIM) or change-detection mechanism will be employed to monitor and protect audit \nlogs (where feasible based on system criticality, design and requirements). Any unauthorized or unexpected changes to the logs must \ngenerate real-time alerts.\nContinuous Monitoring: All log data will be subjected to continuous monitoring, with alerts configured to detect suspicious or \nmalicious activities targeting audit logs.\nReview and Accountability:\nPeriodic Reviews: Logs related to privileged user activities, including system administrators and operators, will be reviewed \nregularly to ensure compliance with security policies and detect any misuse or unauthorized actions.\nAccountability: All activities carried out by privileged users (e.g., system administrators) will be logged. These logs will be reviewed \nby security personnel and subjected to routine audits to maintain accountability.\nPrivileged Operations Logging:\nDelegated Operations: In instances where privileged operations have been delegated to the company by third parties or customers, \nthe performance of these operations will be logged and safeguarded. This ensures that all privileged actions are traceable and can \nbe audited when necessary.\nBy implementing these protections, the integrity and availability of audit logs are maintained, ensuring they provide reliable evidence for \naudits, investigations, and security monitoring.\n3.6 Monitoring\nFailures in critical security control systems must be detected, alerted, and resolved promptly to maintain the integrity of the company's \ninfrastructure. The systems that must be monitored include:\nNetwork Security Controls: \nIntrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): Monitors network traffic for suspicious activities and responds to threats.\nFirewalls: Ensures unauthorized network traffic is blocked, with real-time monitoring of firewall rule changes and suspicious \nconnection attempts.\nAccess Controls: \nPhysical Access Controls: Monitoring systems that track and alert on unauthorized physical access to sensitive areas such as data \ncenters (not applicable for cloud environment, maintained by cloud provider).\nLogical Access Controls: Ensuring that login attempts, failed logins, privilege escalations, and other access control mechanisms \nare actively monitored and alerting for unauthorized attempts.\nAudit Logs: \nAutomated Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of audit logs to detect anomalies, security breaches, and policy violations.\nPeriodic Reviews: Manual review of logs by authorized personnel to ensure adherence to company security policies and standards.\nChange Detection Mechanisms: \nFile Integrity Monitoring: Tracks and alerts on unauthorized changes to critical system files, configurations, and security settings.\nSystem Configuration Monitoring: Detects any unsanctioned system changes, such as unauthorized software installations or \nmisconfigurations.\nAnti-malware Solutions: \nThreat Detection: Continuous monitoring for malware infections, suspicious activity, and potential threats across systems, with \nautomatic alerts and incident reporting.\nFailures identified within any of these critical control systems must be addressed promptly in accordance with the incident response \npolicy. Actions include:\nRestoring Security Functions:\nSecurity functions must be immediately restored to minimize downtime and prevent further damage or compromise.\nDocumenting the Failure:\n\nDuration: Accurately recording the start and end times of the security failure.\nCause Identification: Investigating the root cause of the failure and documenting it comprehensively.\nAddressing Security Issues:\nImpact Assessment: Identifying and addressing any security risks or vulnerabilities exposed by the failure.\nRemediation: Implementing immediate fixes to resolve the issues, whether it is through patching, reconfiguring, or updating systems.\nEvaluating Future Risk:\nPreventative Actions: Implementing controls or improvements to prevent the reoccurrence of the failure.\nResuming Monitoring: Ensuring that the affected systems and controls are returned to full monitoring status to continue \nsafeguarding against future incidents.\nIncident Reporting:\nSecurity incidents resulting from control failures must be logged, reported, and shared with relevant stakeholders, including IT and \nsecurity teams, ensuring transparency and prompt action.\nBy enforcing continuous monitoring and establishing robust incident response mechanisms, the company ensures that failures in security \ncontrols are detected and addressed efficiently to minimize the impact on its operations and data security.\n4 Document Administration\n4.1 Ownership and Review\n  \n4.2 Monitoring and Enforcement\n4.3 Related Documents\n4.3.1 Internal documents\nInformation Security Policy \nInformation Security Organization Policy\nChange Management Policy \nConfiguration Management Plan  \n4.4 Approvals\nThe Document Owner owns this Document and is responsible for reviewing the Document for updates annually, or following any major \nchanges to Squirro AG's compliance environment.

facilities, infrastructure, and sensitive data based on a risk-\nbased approach and implemented where feasible. \nAccess Restriction: Physical access to the company's secure facilities, such as server rooms and critical infrastructure, is restricted to \nauthorized personnel only. In remote locations, employees are responsible for securing access to company resources through digital \nmeans, such as VPNs and secure login systems.\nEmployee Identification: In secure controlled facilities, employees are required to wear identification badges to distinguish themselves \nas authorized personnel. In remote environments, this control may not be applicable but should be supplemented by other identity \nverification methods where necessary.\nVisitor Management: Visitors and vendors must be escorted by an authorized employee at all times while on company premises. Visitor \naccess may not be applicable in remote locations, but employees are required to ensure the confidentiality and security of any sensitive \ninformation.\nIncident Reporting: All workforce members are responsible for reporting unauthorized visitors or access attempts to company facilities \nor systems. This includes both physical locations and remote work environments. Reporting should be immediate to the Security Officer \nor Facility Manager.\nRecord-Keeping: It is recommended to retain a detailed record of each physical access, including visits, maintenance, and repairs \nwhere feasible.\nGiven the remote nature of many locations, physical controls will be implemented flexibly based on an assessment of the risks involved in \neach environment.\n3.2 Access Requirements\nPhysical access to secure facilities is managed through badge readers, smart locks, and physical keys. In environments where these \ncontrols are not applicable, such as coworking spaces, alternative security measures based on risk assessments will be applied.\nBadge and Key Management: Access to the company's badge and key systems is restricted to authorized personnel based on a need-\nto-know basis. Workforce members must report lost or stolen keys or badges immediately to their manager, and the Facility Manager \nmust re-provision access or change locks within 7 days.\nRestricted Areas: Secure areas, such as server rooms, must be locked when unattended, and access is granted only to authorized \nemployees. In remote or coworking environments, employees must ensure their devices and sensitive information are secured.\nVisitor Controls: Visitors must sign a log upon entering secure facilities, indicating the date, time, purpose, and point of contact. Visitor \nlogs must be kept for at least 3 months. In remote environments, visitor controls may not be applicable but should be replaced by strong \ndigital access controls.\nLoading and Delivery Areas: Access to loading and delivery areas is restricted to authorized personnel, and shipments should be \ninspected according to Asset Management procedures. In remote locations, this control may not be necessary but should be considered \nif the location handles sensitive assets.\n3.3 Maintenance and Monitoring\nContinuous monitoring and maintenance of physical security systems are crucial for protecting the company's assets. These requirements \napply primarily to formal company locations, while remote work environments may not require such stringent controls.\nMany of the company's operations take place either in its own offices or remotely, including at home, in cafes, or coworking spaces. \nThe company's own offices may also be considered as remote locations in certain contexts.\nAs a result, certain physical security controls, such as badge systems or visitor logs, may not be applicable to all environments. \nSecurity measures will be applied based on a risk-based approach and implemented where feasible. The specific controls \nimplemented will vary depending on the location and the nature of the activities being conducted there.\n\nMaintenance of Security Equipment: Any repairs or maintenance to physical security equipment, including locks, cameras, and access \ncontrol systems, must be documented, with records retained for at least seven years.\nCCTV Monitoring: Secure areas must be monitored by CCTV, with recordings stored for at least 3 months. For remote locations, \nemployees are responsible for ensuring security through digital means, such as monitoring login activity and using endpoint security \nmeasures.\nAlarm Systems: Alarm systems must be installed in critical areas and tested regularly. In remote work environments, employees should \nensure the security of their workspace, devices, and data through encryption and secure access controls.\n3.4 Workstation Security\nWorkstation security is essential to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive company data. In formal facilities, workstations are protected \nby physical and technical safeguards, while in remote locations, employees must follow strict digital security measures.\nAccess to Workstations: Only authorized employees may access company-owned workstations, and these devices must be used \nsolely for business purposes. Workstations must be locked or logged off when left unattended.\nPhysical Safeguards: In shared or open workspaces, workstations must be positioned to prevent unauthorized viewing of sensitive \ninformation. Employees should use privacy filters or position screens away from public view.\nPortable Device Security: Laptops and other portable devices containing sensitive information must be secured when left unattended, \nusing cable locks or locked storage. Employees in remote environments must also adhere to the company's Encryption Policy.\n3.5 Visitor and Vendor Management\nVisitor and vendor access to company facilities must be tightly controlled, though these measures may not be applicable in remote work \nenvironments.\nEscort Requirement: Visitors and vendors must be escorted by an authorized company employee while on the premises. Remote \nenvironments, such as cafes, may not have the need for physical escorts, but sensitive data must be protected.\nVisitor Badges: Visitors in formal company locations must wear badges that distinguish them from employees. These badges must be \nreturned when leaving the facility.\nVisitor Logs: Logs documenting visitor access, including date, time, and purpose, must be maintained for at least 3 months. In remote \nenvironments, visitor logs may not apply, but employees must ensure secure access to any shared devices or data.\n3.6 Data Center and Building Standards\nThe company does not maintain its own data centers and instead relies on cloud infrastructure providers such as AWS and Azure. However, \nany physical infrastructure under the company's control must adhere to high security standards.\nSecurity Perimeters: Secure perimeters must be established around areas containing critical data or infrastructure. Entry points should \nbe protected with access controls and monitored by surveillance cameras.\nCCTV Monitoring: Critical areas must be monitored by CCTV, and recordings must be kept for at least 3 months.\nBackup Power: Backup power supplies, such as UPS systems, must be available for critical infrastructure to ensure continuous \noperations during power outages.\nEmergency Power Shut-off: Emergency power shut-off switches must be located near exits in critical equipment rooms to allow for \nrapid shutdown during emergencies.\n3.7 Enforcement of Facility Access Policies\nTo ensure compliance with security policies, violations of these controls will result in investigation and potential disciplinary actions.\nIncident Reporting: Employees, visitors, and vendors must report any violations of physical security policies to their manager or the \nSecurity Officer immediately.\n\nDisciplinary Actions: Employees found violating these policies may face disciplinary actions, up to and including termination. Visitors \nand vendors may have their access privileges revoked.\nIn remote environments, security measures may be adapted based on risk assessments, but all employees are responsible for safeguarding \ncompany data and resources. Non-compliance will be investigated and addressed accordingly.\n4 Document Administration\n4.1 Ownership and Review\n  \n4.2 Monitoring and Enforcement\n4.3 Related Documents\n4.3.1 Internal documents\nInformation Security Policy \nInformation Security Organization Policy\n4.4 Approvals\n4.5 Revision History\nFollow the link for details of revisions. \nThe Document Owner owns this Document and is responsible for reviewing the Document for updates annually, or following any major \nchanges to Squirro AG's compliance environment.

The classification note \"internal use\" or \n\n\"confidential\" shall be placed on the title page and/or in the footer of the document.\n\nElectronic Information Tagging: Electronic information and data should be tagged with the available metadata.\n\nDevice Labeling: In order to keep the administrative effort within manageable limits, the devices carrying data are not labeled. \n\nEmployees are instructed to treat such devices and mobile devices as if they contained classified information.\n\nAccess Control: Access to information categorized as \"confidential\" is given on a \"need-to-know\" basis, i.e., an individual only receives \n\naccess to such information to the extent necessary for the performance of his or her work. Information categorized as \"internal use\" \n\nshould be available to employees by default.\n\nPrivileged Users: Classified information is only made available to privileged users. In the case of electronically stored information, \n\nappropriate authorizations must be assigned.\n\nSecurity of Devices: Devices carrying data and devices on which classified information is stored shall be kept securely locked or \n\npassword protected (e.g., employee laptops should not be locked, but should be password protected).\n\nData Deletion: If classified information on data carriers and devices is to be deleted, it should be done in line Asset Management Poli\n\ncy | 3.13 Disposal of Media and Devices and lead to the permanent destruction of such information.\n\nDefault Classification: Documents without a label should by default be treated as \"Internal Use\" unless they are marketing or sales \n\nmaterials or materials intended to be available publicly or for selected external parties (which should be verified with the document \n\nowner).\n\nThese generic requirements ensure that information is classified, labeled, reviewed, and protected appropriately, maintaining the security \n\nand integrity of the company's data throughout its lifecycle.\n\n3.2 Data Classification Scheme\n\nData classification, in the context of information security, is the classification of data based on its level of sensitivity and the impact to the \n\ncompany should that data be disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization. The classification of data helps determine what baseline \n\nsecurity controls are appropriate for safeguarding that data. All data should be classified into one of the following classifications:\n\n3.2.1 Confidential/Restricted Data\n\nData should be classified as Confidential/Restricted when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data could cause a \n\nserious or significant level of risk to the company or its customers. Examples of sensitive data include data protected by state or federal \n\nprivacy regulations (e.g., PHI & PII) and data protected by confidentiality agreements. The highest level of security controls should be \n\napplied to Confidential/Restricted Data:\n\nAccess Restrictions: Disclosure or access to Confidential/Restricted data is limited to specific use by individuals with a legitimate need-\n\nto-know. Explicit authorization by the CISO is required for access due to legal, contractual, privacy, or other constraints.\n\nProtection Measures: Must be protected to prevent loss, theft, unauthorized access, and/or unauthorized disclosure.\n\nData Destruction: Must be destroyed when no longer needed. Destruction must be in accordance with company policies and \n\nprocedures.\n\n\n\nIncident Response: Will require specific methodologies, procedures, and reporting requirements for the response and handling of \n\nincidents.\n\n3.2.2 Internal Use Data\n\nData should be classified as Internal Use when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data could result in a moderate \n\nlevel of risk to the company or its customers. This includes proprietary, ethical, or privacy considerations. Data must be protected from \n\nunauthorized access, modification, transmission, storage, or other use. This applies even though there may not be a civil statute requiring \n\nthis protection. Internal Use Data is restricted to personnel who have a legitimate reason to access it. By default, all data that is not explicitly \n\nclassified as Confidential/Restricted or Public data should be treated as Internal Use data. A reasonable level of security controls should be \n\napplied to Internal Use Data.\n\n3.2.3 Public Data\n\nData should be classified as Public when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data would result in little or no risk to \n\nthe company and its customers. It is further defined as information with no existing local, national, or international legal restrictions on \n\naccess or usage. While little or no controls are required to protect the confidentiality of Public data, some level of control is required to \n\nprevent unauthorized alteration or destruction of Public Data.\n\n3.3.1 Classification Guidance\n\nIf a classification is not inherently obvious, consider each security objective using the following table as a guide. All data will be assigned one \n\nof the following four sensitivity levels:\n\n4 - \n\nRESTRICTE\n\nD (Critical)\n\nHighly \n\nsensitive \n\ninformation.\n\nDictated \n\nexternally by legal \n\nand/or contractual \n\nrequirements.\n\nMust be limited to \n\nonly authorized \n\nemployees, \n\ncontractors, and \n\nbusiness partners \n\nwith a specific \n\nbusiness need.\n\nSeriousImpact could \n\ninclude negatively \n\naffecting the \n\ncompany's \n\ncompetitive \n\nposition, violating \n\nregulatory \n\nrequirements, \n\ndamaging the \n\ncompany's \n\nPHI, sensitive PII, \n\nconfidential \n\nagreements\n\nClassificati\n\non\n\nDescriptionProtectionAccessDamageImpactExamples\n\n\n\nLegend:\n\nClassification: The level of sensitivity assigned to the data.\n\nDescription: An overview of the type of information and its sensitivity.\n\nProtection: The required level of protection based on legal, contractual, or internal policies.\n\nAccess: Who is allowed to access the data and under what conditions.\n\nDamage: The level of damage which would occur information were to become available to unauthorized parties.\n\nImpact: The potential consequences if the data were to be disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization.\n\nExamples: Typical examples of data that fall under each classification level.\n\n3.3.2 Labeling\n\nData must be labeled according to its classification to ensure proper handling. Labels should be clear and indicate the level of sensitivity. For \n\nexample:\n\nRestricted: \"CONFIDENTIAL/RESTRICTED\"\n\nConfidential: \"CONFIDENTIAL\"\n\nInternal Use: \"INTERNAL USE ONLY\"\n\nPublic: No specific label required\n\nreputation, violating \n\ncontractual \n\nrequirements, and \n\nposing an identity \n\ntheft risk.\n\n3 - \n\nCONFIDENT\n\nIAL (High)\n\nSensitive \n\ninformation.\n\nDictated internally \n\nby the company.\n\nMust be limited to \n\nonly authorized \n\nemployees, \n\ncontractors, and \n\nbusiness partners \n\nwith a specific \n\nbusiness need.\n\nSignificantImpact could \n\ninclude negatively \n\naffecting the \n\ncompany's \n\ncompetitive \n\nposition, damaging \n\nthe company's \n\nreputation, violating \n\ncontractual \n\nrequirements, and \n\nexposing the \n\ngeographic location \n\nof individuals.\n\nInternal memos, \n\nproprietary \n\nbusiness \n\ninformation, \n\ngeneral PII\n\n2 - \n\nINTERNAL \n\nUSE \n\n(Medium)\n\nNon-sensitive \n\ninformation.\n\nOriginating within \n\nor owned by the \n\ncompany, or \n\nentrusted to it by \n\nothers.\n\nMay be shared \n\nwith authorized \n\nemployees, \n\ncontractors, and \n\nbusiness partners \n\nwho have a \n\nbusiness need.\n\nModerateImpact could \n\ninclude damaging \n\nthe company's \n\nreputation and \n\nviolating contractual \n\nrequirements.\n\nInternal emails, \n\nproject documents\n\n1 - PUBLIC \n\n(Low)\n\nInformation \n\nthat has been \n\napproved for \n\nrelease to the \n\ngeneral public.\n\nFreely shareable \n\nboth internally and \n\nexternally.\n\nNo specific access \n\nrestrictions.\n\nNo damageImpact would not be \n\ndamaging or a risk \n\nto business \n\noperations.\n\nPress releases, \n\nmarketing \n\nmaterials\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Cloud Computing Environment\n\nWhen maintaining information and associated assets in the cloud computing environment, the cloud service customer is expected to label \n\nthese assets following the company's defined procedures for labeling. This may include the utilization of labeling functionalities provided by \n\nthe cloud service provider, where relevant. The cloud service provider is obliged to document and reveal any service functionality it offers, \n\nenabling the company to classify and label their information and associated assets.\n\nProper classification and labeling are crucial for maintaining the security of data. By categorizing data based on its sensitivity and applying \n\nappropriate labels, the company can ensure that data is handled correctly and securely, both within the organization and in cloud \n\nenvironments. This process helps protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of corporate and customer data.\n\n4 - \n\nRESTRICTE\n\nD (Critical)\n\nRequired \n\nprior to \n\naccess by \n\nnon-\n\ncompany \n\nemployees \n\nEncryption \n\nRequired\n\nInstant \n\nMessaging \n\nProhibited\n\nInsecure \n\nTransfer \n\nProtocols \n\nProhibited \n\nEncryption \n\nRequired\n\nInstant \n\nMessaging \n\nProhibited\n\nInsecure \n\nTransfer \n\nProtocols \n\nProhibited\n\nRemote Access if \n\nNecessary (only \n\nwith VPN and \n\ntwo-factor \n\nauthorization \n\nwhen possible) \n\nEncryption \n\nRequired\n\nLogical Access \n\nControls \n\nRequired (Limit \n\nUnauthorized \n\nUse)\n\nPhysical \n\nAccess \n\nRestricted to \n\nSpecific \n\nIndividuals \n\nEncryption \n\nRequired\n\nRemote Wipe \n\nEnablement \n\nRequired, if \n\npossible \n\nEncryption \n\nRequired\n\nDo Not \n\nForward \n\nMark \"Open by \n\nAddressee \n\nOnly\"\n\nUse Courier or \n\n\"Certified Mail\" \n\nand Sealed, \n\nTamper-\n\nResistant \n\nEnvelopes for \n\nExternal \n\nMailings \n\n3 -

The policy ensures the protection of sensitive data and IT \n\nsystems by regulating user access in accordance with security principles such as least privilege and segregation of duties. Additionally, it \n\noutlines the process for access establishment, modification, and termination to minimize risks and maintain the integrity and confidentiality of \n\ncompany assets.\n\n1.2 Scope\n\nThis policy applies to all company personnel, including employees, contractors, consultants, third-party service providers, and any other \n\nauthorized users who have access to the company's information systems and data. It governs all assets and systems, including hardware, \n\nsoftware, applications, and databases, whether on-premises or cloud-based, that are used to store, process, or transmit company \n\ninformation.\n\n2 Roles and Responsibilities\n\n2.1 Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)\n\nThe CISO is responsible for overseeing the overall security strategy, ensuring compliance with security standards, and maintaining \n\ninformation security throughout the company.\n\nSecurity Strategy Oversight: Responsible for the development, implementation, and oversight of the security strategy to protect \n\ncompany assets and information.\n\nPolicy Enforcement: Ensures adherence to the System Access Control Policy, reviewing access privileges to systems and data on a \n\nregular basis.\n\nIncident Response: Leads the investigation and resolution of security incidents related to unauthorized access or policy violations.\n\nCompliance: Ensures compliance with regulatory standards and industry best practices for access control.\n\nThe CISO plays a critical role in ensuring that access control measures are enforced consistently and that security protocols align with \n\nbusiness objectives and legal requirements.\n\n2.3 Responsible for Information Security (RIS)\n\nThe RIS manages the day-to-day implementation and monitoring of the access control measures and ensures compliance with security \n\npolicies.\n\nAccess Control Management: Responsible for managing user access rights, including granting, modifying, and revoking access based \n\non job functions and responsibilities.\n\nSecurity Monitoring: Oversees the monitoring of systems for unauthorized access attempts and compliance with access control \n\nprotocols.\n\nIncident Reporting: Reports security incidents and access control violations to the CISO for further investigation and resolution.\n\nThe RIS plays a vital role in the operational aspect of access control, ensuring that security measures are applied consistently across all \n\nsystems.\n\n2.4 Systems Administrator\n\nThe Systems Administrator is responsible for the technical implementation and maintenance of access control mechanisms.\n\nAccount Management: Manages the creation, modification, and deletion of user accounts in accordance with the access control policy.\n\nAccess Audits: Conducts regular access audits to ensure compliance with the policy and identify any discrepancies in user access \n\nrights.\n\nTechnical Support: Provides technical support for the enforcement of access control measures and troubleshooting related to access \n\nissues.\n\nThe Systems Administrator ensures the technical enforcement of the access control policies and manages the infrastructure that supports it.\n\n2.5 Employees and Contractors\n\nEmployees and contractors are required to adhere to the company's access control policies and report any unauthorized access or \n\nsuspicious activity.\n\nAccess Adherence: Ensures that their access to systems and data is in line with their job functions and responsibilities.\n\nIncident Reporting: Reports any unauthorized access or attempts to breach system security.\n\nPolicy Compliance: Follows the procedures outlined in the access control policy, including maintaining the confidentiality of login \n\ncredentials.\n\nEmployees and contractors are responsible for adhering to the access control measures and contributing to the security of company \n\nsystems.\n\n\n\n3 Policy\n\n3.1 Access Establishment and Modification\n\nAccess to the company's information systems is granted based on the minimum necessary data access required for job responsibilities. All \n\naccess is regulated using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), adhering to the Principle of Least Privilege to ensure that each user has \n\nonly the necessary access required to perform their duties.\n\nMinimum Necessary Access: User access to systems is determined by job classification, ensuring that only the minimum necessary \n\nlevel of access is granted.\n\nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC): The assignment of user rights and access to systems is regulated by the RBAC method, \n\nensuring that access levels align with user roles and responsibilities.\n\nSegregation of Duties: The need for segregation of duties is considered when assigning user rights, preventing potential conflicts of \n\ninterest or undue concentration of authority.\n\nFormal Documentation and Authorization: All access requests, including the addition, deletion, and modification of user IDs, \n\nauthentication factors, and other identifying objects, must be documented and formally authorized.\n\nAccess Request Process: Workforce members initiate access requests by creating an issue in the company's ticketing system, \n\ndetailing the type of access needed.\n\nIdentity Verification: User identities must be verified in person whenever possible before granting access to new accounts. For remote \n\nemployees, verification may be conducted over the phone, with the method of verification recorded in the ticketing system.\n\nAuthorization by Security Officer: The Security Officer is responsible for granting or rejecting access based on the employee's role \n\nand job classification. If additional access is required, the requester must provide a valid reason as part of the request.\n\nReview and Documentation: If an access request is rejected, it must go through a further review process, with detailed documentation. \n\nApproved requests are marked as complete and include all pertinent notes.\n\nAccess to the company's systems is carefully regulated through RBAC, ensuring that users are granted only the minimum necessary access \n\nfor their roles. Formal documentation and identity verification are required, with reviews conducted for additional access requests to \n\nmaintain security and accountability.\n\n3.2 Access Reviews\n\nUser access to company systems and services will be subject to periodic reviews to ensure that accounts, including third-party or vendor \n\naccounts, are appropriately assigned based on job functions. These reviews help maintain compliance with the Principle of Least Privilege \n\nand ensure access rights are adjusted as needed.\n\nQuarterly Access Reviews: Management will conduct formal access reviews at least once every quarter to verify that the roles and \n\npermissions associated with all user accounts, including third-party or vendor accounts, are still appropriate.\n\nJob Function Alignment: Access reviews focus on ensuring that user roles and permissions are aligned with current job functions and \n\nthat no excess or unauthorized access exists.\n\nManagement Authorization: During the access review, management is responsible for confirming that user accounts are in compliance \n\nwith established authorization requirements.\n\nQuarterly access reviews ensure that user accounts, including third-party and vendor accounts, remain aligned with job responsibilities, \n\npreventing unnecessary or unauthorized access to sensitive systems. These reviews are a key part of the company's efforts to maintain \n\nappropriate security controls.\n\n3.3 User Identification and Authentication\n\nTo ensure the security of system components, users and administrators must be authenticated using at least one authentication factor. This \n\nprocess is critical to safeguarding the company's systems and sensitive information.\n\nAuthentication Factors: Access will require at least one of the following:\n\nSomething you know, such as a password or passphrase.\n\n\n\nSomething you have, such as a token device or smart card.\n\nSomething you are, such as a biometric element.\n\nUnique Login Credentials: Each user will have a unique login ID and password, ensuring individual accountability.\n\nAuthentication Requirements: Single sign-on (SSO) and minimum password requirements will be enforced based on the company's \n\nPassword Policy. Passwords will never be displayed, transmitted, or stored in plain text.\n\nDefault Accounts: Default accounts on all production systems, including root, will be deleted, disabled, or restricted to a limited number \n\nof authorized administrators. These accounts will only be used under exceptional circumstances with documented business justification \n\nand management approval.\n\nShared Accounts: The use of group, shared, or generic accounts is prohibited unless absolutely necessary and approved by \n\nmanagement. Individual user identity must be confirmed before access is granted, and all actions must be traceable to a specific user.\n\nAuthentication Tokens: Physical or logical tokens, smart cards, or certificates will be assigned to individual users and cannot be \n\nshared. Additional controls, such as PINs or biometric data, will ensure only authorized users can access accounts.\n\nAutomated Log-on: Automated log-on configurations, other than the company's approved password management tools, are prohibited \n\nfrom storing user passwords or bypassing password entry on workstations or production systems.\n\nThe company enforces strict identification and authentication policies, requiring the use of unique credentials, secure authentication factors, \n\nand limiting access to default and shared accounts. These measures ensure accountability and safeguard access to critical systems.\n\n3.4 Multi-factor Authentication\n\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all system access where technically feasible, providing an additional layer of security for \n\nusers, administrators, and third parties.\n\nUse of MFA: MFA will be enforced to enhance security by requiring multiple types of authentication for access to systems.\n\nSystem Configuration: Systems using MFA must:\n\nPrevent replay attacks through secure token generation and validation processes.\n\nRequire at least two distinct types of authentication factors (e.g., something you know, something you have, or something you are).\n\nRestrict any bypassing of MFA by users, including administrative users, unless specifically documented and approved by \n\nmanagement on an exception basis, for a limited time period.\n\nRemote Access: MFA is mandatory for all remote access to the company's network, including access by users, administrators, and \n\nthird-party vendors. This ensures that remote connections are secure and access is only granted to authenticated users.\n\nMulti-factor authentication is essential to securing system access, particularly for remote access scenarios. By requiring multiple \n\nauthentication factors and preventing unauthorized bypassing, the company maintains a high level of security for all users and systems.\n\n\n\n3.7 Application and System Accounts\n\nApplication and system accounts will be managed to ensure access is limited to only what is necessary for system operability and will follow \n\nstrict guidelines for security.\n\nProvisioning of Accounts: All application and system accounts will be provisioned based on documented authorization from \n\nmanagement. Access privileges will be limited to only what is necessary for the application or system to function effectively, \n\nminimizing unnecessary access.\n\nInteractive Login Management: \n\nPrevention of Interactive Use: Interactive login through system or application accounts will be prevented unless specifically \n\nrequired for an exceptional circumstance. \n\nTime-Limited Access: If interactive access is required, it will be restricted to the necessary timeframe to complete the required \n\ntask. \n\nBusiness Justification: A documented business justification must accompany any request for interactive login, explaining why \n\nsuch access is necessary.\n\nManagement Approval: Interactive use must be explicitly approved by management, ensuring that only authorized personnel can \n\nuse the account.\n\nAccountability: Every action taken using an interactive account must be attributable to an individual user. Individual user identity \n\nwill be confirmed before access is granted.\n\nApplication and system accounts will be tightly controlled to ensure that they are only used for necessary system operations, with interactive \n\naccess limited to exceptional circumstances and approved by management. Every action must be linked to an identifiable user to maintain \n\naccountability.\n\n3.8 Use of Utility Programs\n\nAccess to utility programs that have the potential to bypass normal operating system or application controls will be restricted to authorized \n\npersonnel to maintain the security and integrity of the company's systems.\n\nRestricted Access to Utility Programs: Only authorized system administrators will have access to manage utility programs such as \n\nanti-virus consoles, diagnostic tools, patching software, backup utilities, and network tools. These programs will be restricted from \n\ngeneral user access due to their ability to bypass normal security controls.\n\nPrivileged Utility Access Control: \n\nStandard User Restrictions: Standard users will be restricted from accessing privileged utilities or making modifications to their \n\nconfigurations.\n\n\n\nAuthentication and Access Controls: Strict authentication mechanisms and access controls will be implemented to ensure only \n\nauthorized administrators can access or modify utility programs, preventing unauthorized changes to the system.\n\nUtility programs with the ability to bypass security controls will be strictly restricted to authorized system administrators, with standard users \n\ndenied access. This ensures the integrity of system configurations and limits unauthorized access to privileged tools.\n\n3.9 Employee Termination/Offboarding Procedures\n\nThe company will revoke system and physical access for terminated users (employees, third parties, vendors, and other personnel) \n\npromptly to safeguard its systems and data.\n\nAccess Revocation: System and physical access will be revoked within one business day of the termination date. This applies to all \n\nterminated users including employees, vendors, and third parties.\n\nTermination Checklist and Notification:\n\nThe HR/People department, along with the users and their supervisors, are responsible for notifying system administrators of \n\nupcoming separations and ensuring the completion of a \"Termination Checklist.\"\n\nSystem administrators will terminate access rights within the established service level agreements (SLAs) upon notification of \n\ntermination or separation.\n\nAsset Return Tracking: \n\nThe HR/People department (or designated department) will track the return of all electronic and physical assets, including \n\nlaptops, files, access mechanisms (such as keys, access cards, badges, and multi-factor authentication tokens) as part of the \n\noffboarding process.\n\nIncident-Based Access Termination:\n\nSystem administrators will terminate a user's access if there is evidence or suspicion that:\n\nThe user has been misusing their access rights.\n\nA user's password has been compromised. If the user is not responsible for the password compromise, a new password may \n\nbe provided.\n\nUpon termination, the company ensures that access to systems and physical locations is revoked within one business day, while the \n\nHR/People department oversees asset returns and the completion of termination procedures. Access is also terminated if there is misuse or \n\nevidence of a password compromise.\n\n3.10 Disabling Accounts: High-Risk Users\n\nThe company will disable accounts of users deemed to pose a high risk to its systems and data. Accounts will be disabled for a specified \n\nperiod depending on the risk severity.\n\nUser intends to sell company information to a competitor Immediately                 1 month                     \n\nUser accesses unauthorized sensitive data without a business \n\nneed \n\nImmediately                 3 weeks                     \n\nUser deliberately attempts to bypass security controls Immediately                 6 weeks                     \n\nUser leaks confidential information to external parties Immediately                 2 months                    \n\nUser violates policy by sharing credentials Immediately                 2 weeks                     \n\nUser installs unauthorized software or malware Immediately                 1 month                     \n\nUser repeatedly fails to comply with security procedures Immediately                 4 weeks                     \n\nUser uses company resources for illegal activities Immediately                 Permanent Disablement       \n\nRiskTime Period to DisableDuration of Disablement\n\n\n\nHigh-risk accounts will be disabled promptly based on the nature of the risk and the severity of the violation. The duration of disablement is \n\ndetermined by the risk posed to the company's systems and data integrity.\n\n4 Document Administration\n\n4.1 Ownership and Review\n\nInformation Security Policy \n\nInformation Security Organization Policy\n\n4.4 Approvals\n\n4.5 Revision History\n\nFollow the link for details of revisions. \n\nThe Document Owner owns this Document and is responsible for reviewing the Document for updates annually, or following any major \n\nchanges to Squrrio AG's compliance environment.

This process is consistent with the company's cultural values, \n\nHuman Resources (HR) best practices, and employment laws.\n\nThe company reserves the right to combine or skip steps depending on the facts of each situation and the nature of the offense. The level of \n\ndisciplinary intervention may vary based on factors such as whether the offense is repeated despite coaching, counseling, or training, the \n\nemployee's work record, and the impact the conduct and performance issues have on the organization.\n\n3.11.1 Step 1: Verbal Warning and Counseling\n\nDescription: This initial step creates an opportunity for the immediate supervisor to schedule a meeting with an employee to bring \n\nattention to an existing performance, conduct, or attendance issue. The supervisor should discuss with the employee the nature of the \n\nproblem or the violation of company policies and procedures. The supervisor is expected to clearly describe expectations and the steps \n\nthe employee must take to improve performance or resolve the problem.\n\n3.11.2 Step 2: Formal Written Warning\n\nDescription: If the employee does not promptly correct any performance, conduct, or attendance issues that were identified in Step 1, a \n\nwritten warning will become formal documentation of the performance, conduct, or attendance issues and consequences. The employee \n\nwill sign a copy of the document to acknowledge receipt and understanding of the formal warning. During Step 2, the immediate \n\nsupervisor and HR representative will meet with the employee to review any additional incidents or information about the performance, \n\nconduct, or attendance issues as well as any prior relevant corrective action plans. Management will outline the consequences for the \n\nemployee of his or her continued failure to meet performance or conduct expectations.\n\nPerformance Improvement Plan (PIP): A formal performance improvement plan (PIP) requiring the employee's immediate and \n\nsustained corrective action will be issued after a Step 2 meeting. A warning outlining that the employee may be subject to additional \n\ndiscipline up to and including termination if immediate and sustained corrective action is not taken may also be included in the written \n\nwarning.\n\n3.11.3 Step 3: Suspension and Final Written Warning\n\nDescription: There may be performance, conduct, or safety incidents so problematic and harmful that the most effective action may be \n\nthe temporary removal of the employee from the workplace. When immediate action is necessary to ensure the safety of the employee \n\nor others, the immediate supervisor may suspend the employee pending the results of an investigation. Suspensions that are \n\nrecommended as part of the normal progression of this progressive discipline policy and procedure are subject to approval from a next-\n\nlevel manager and HR.\n\n3.11.4 Step 4: Recommendation for Termination of Employment\n\nDescription: The last step in the progressive discipline procedure is a recommendation to terminate employment. Generally, the \n\ncompany will try to exercise the progressive nature of this policy by first providing warnings, a final written warning or suspension from \n\nthe workplace before proceeding to a recommendation to terminate employment. However, the company reserves the right to combine \n\nand skip steps depending on the circumstances of each situation and the nature of the offense. Furthermore, employees may be \n\nterminated without prior notice or disciplinary action.\n\nApproval Process: Management's recommendation to terminate employment must be approved by HR and the supervisor's immediate \n\nmanager.

Checkstep will manage all system and application changes\n\nsubject to this policy (e.g. operating system, computing hardware, networks, applications, data centers) in accordance\n\nwith the applicable change management procedures.\n\nProcedures\n\nThe objective of this process is to manage the introduction of any change into production by ensuring that the correct\n\nprocedures are being followed, proper documentation has been completed, proper testing has been performed, and\n\nproper approval is in place.\n\nOrganizational Change Control\n\nThe following procedures apply to all changes, including infrastructure, code, and networking changes, as well as the\n\ndeployment of new hardware:\n\n•A record of agreed authorization levels will be maintained.\n\n•Changes are only submitted by authorized users.\n\n•Controls and integrity procedures will be reviewed to ensure that they will not be compromised by the\n\nchanges.\n\n•Security critical code to minimize the likelihood of known security weaknesses will be identified and\n\nchecked.\n\n•Formal approval must be obtained for detailed proposals before work begins.\n\n•Changes will be implemented at a time that is least intrusive to business processes involved.\n\n•Vendor-supplied software will be used without modification; in the event that a modification is necessary, the\n\nfollowing will be evaluated:\n\n◦Risk of compromising built-in controls and integrity processes\n\n◦Vendor consent\n\n◦Getting the modifications from vendor as standard updates\n\n◦Impact of owning the responsibility for maintaining the program\n\n◦Compatibility with other software in use.\n\n•A technical review of applications will be conducted after changes to operating platforms (operating systems,\n\ndatabases and middleware platforms). The review will include:\n\n\n\n◦Application control and integrity procedures to ensure that they have not been compromised by the\n\noperating platform changes.\n\n◦Timely notification of operating platform changes to allow appropriate tests and reviews to take\n\nplace before implementation.\n\n◦Appropriate changes are made to the business continuity plans.\n\n•Customers must be notified of major changes (new subprocessor, etc.) or changes that may lead to system\n\ndowntime, at least 2 business days prior to their deployment to the production environment.\n\nPlanned Changes\n\nFor planned changes, Checkstep will:\n\n•Plan the implementation and assign tasks, responsibilities, deadlines and resources using the internal changes\n\ntracking system;\n\n•For the significant changes that impact the product on a deeper level the Architecture Decision Record (ADR)\n\nwill be filed in the ADR catalog;\n\n•Implement changes according to the plan;\n\n•Monitor the implementation to confirm that they are implemented according to the plan.\n\nUnplanned Changes\n\nFor observed unintended changes, Checkstep will:\n\n•Review consequences of the changes;\n\n•Evaluate the occurrence or potential for occurrence of any adverse effects;\n\n•Plan and implement actions to mitigate any adverse effects as necessary;\n\n•In the case of Emergency Changes (e.g., when a critical vulnerability is discovered and needs to be resolved\n\nimmediately), an expedited process may be conducted.\n\nSoftware Development\n\nFor software development, operating system applications and software changes will only be implemented after\n\nextensive and successful testing:\n\n•The tests will cover:\n\n◦Usability\n\n◦Security\n\n◦Effects on other systems\n\n◦Tests will be conducted on separate systems (test environment), and all corresponding program\n\nsource libraries will also be updated, as appropriate.\n\n•The operational software, applications and program libraries of Checkstep will only be updated by trained\n\nadministrators upon appropriate management authorization.\n\n•Company operational systems will only hold approved executable code, not development code or compilers.\n\n•A configuration control system will be used to keep control of all implemented software as well as the system\n\ndocumentation.\n\n◦Previous versions of software will be retained as a contingency measure.\n\n◦Old versions of software will be archived, together with all required information and parameters,\n\nprocedures, configuration details and supporting software for as long as the data are retained in the\n\narchive.\n\n•There will be a rollback strategy in place before changes are implemented.\n\n•An audit log will be maintained of all updates to operational program libraries.\n\n\n\nVersionDateEditorDescription of Changes\n\n•All decisions to upgrade to a new version release must take into account:\n\n◦Business requirements for the change\n\n◦Security of the release, e.g. the introduction of new information security functionality or the number\n\nand severity of information security problems affecting this version.\n\n•Change security measures will be in place, to include:\n\n◦Branch protection rules (Gitlab);\n\n◦Review & approval from the security team in case of significant changes;\n\n◦Changes deployed to production only by specifically authorized personnel with escalated privileges;\n\nand,\n\n◦Post deployment QA testing to ensure the change is functioning as intended in the production\n\nenvironment.\n\nSupplier Services\n\nManagement of changes to supplier services is covered in theVendor Management Policyin the Policy Center.\n\nConfiguration Management\n\nFor configuration management, production and system network changes will only be implemented with properly\n\nconducted procedures:\n\n•Terraform and Gitlab are used to standardize and automate configuration management.\n\n•No systems are deployed into Checkstep environments without approval of the Checkstep CTO or\n\nEngineering Manager.\n\n•All changes to production systems, network devices, and firewalls are approved by the Checkstep Checkstep\n\nCTO or Engineering Manager before they are implemented to assure they comply with business and security\n\nrequirements.\n\n•All changes to production systems are tested before they are implemented in production.\n\n•Implementation of approved changes are only performed by authorized personnel.\n\n•Tooling to generate an up-to-date inventory of systems, including corresponding architecture diagrams for\n\nrelated products and services, is hosted on Gitlab in the form of Terraform Code.\n\n•All frontend functionality (developer dashboards and portals) is separated from backend (database and app\n\nservers) systems by being deployed on separate servers or containers.\n\n•All committed code is reviewed using pull requests to assure software code quality and proactively detect\n\npotential security issues in development.\n\n•Checkstep utilizes development and staging environments that mirror production to assure proper function.\n\n•All formal change requests require unique ID and authentication.\n\n•Identities assigned to multiple persons (e.g. shared identities) are only permitted where they are necessary for\n\nbusiness or operational reasons and are subject to dedicated approval and documentation.\n\n•Clocks are continuously synchronized to an authoritative source across all systems using a single reference\n\ntime source. Modifying time data on systems is restricted.\n\nRevision History\n\n\n\n1.0January 19, 2023Vilius PankauskasInitial Creation\n\n1.1May 2nd, 2023Vilius PankauskasEdits to match the process of Checkstep\n\n1.112-Nov-2024Vilius Pankauskasno changes\n\n\n\nPolicy version history\n\nPolicy details\n\nPolicy name\n\nChange Management Policy\n\nRenewal date\n\nDecember 1, 2025\n\nDescription\n\nThis policy establishes the company's processes to manage changes across the organization in a well-communicated, planned and\n\npredictable manner that minimizes unplanned outages and unforeseen system issues.\n\nVersion history\n\nVersion 1\n\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\n\nJanuary 12, 2023-Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas\n\nVersion 2\n\nExplanation of changes\n\nNew policy with the edits to match the existing Checkstep process\n\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\n\nMay 2, 2023May 2, 2023Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas\n\nVersion 3\n\nCreation DateApproval DateOwnerApprover\n\nNovember 12, 2024November 18, 2024Vilius PankauskasVilius Pankauskas\n\n\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"result\": \"Invalid\",\n  \"details\": [\n    {\n      \"control\": \"A.8.27 Secure system architecture and engineering principles\",\n      \"issue\": \"There are no things in this policy that can cover this control.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}]}

This will also\n\nincrease awareness about protecting sensitive information. As such:\n\n•Employees are required to ensure that all sensitive/confidential information, hard-copy or electronic, is secure\n\nin their work area at the end of the day and when they are expected to be gone for an extended period.\n\n•Computer workstations must be locked when the workspace is not in use and must be shut down completely\n\nat the end of the day.\n\n•Sensitive information must be removed from the desk and securely stored when the desk is unattended and at\n\nthe end of the day.\n\n•Laptops and other portable computing devices must be properly stored/secured.\n\n•File cabinets containing Restricted or Sensitive information must be kept closed and locked when not in use\n\nor when not attended.\n\n•Keys used for access to Restricted or Sensitive information must not be left at an unattended desk.\n\n•Passwords may not be left on sticky notes posted on or under a computer, nor may they be left written down\n\nin an accessible location.\n\n•Printouts containing Restricted or Sensitive information should be immediately removed from the printer.\n\n•Upon disposal, Restricted and/or Sensitive documents should be shredded in the official shredder bins or\n\nplaced in the locked confidential disposal bins.\n\n•Whiteboards containing Restricted and/or Sensitive information should be erased.\n\n•Treat mass storage devices such as external hard drives or USB drives as sensitive and always secure and\n\nencrypt them.\n\n•All printers and fax machines should be cleared of papers as soon as they are printed; this helps ensure that\n\nsensitive documents are not left in printer trays for the wrong person to pick up.\n\nInternet/Intranet Access and Use\n\nUse of Asolvi AS computers, networks, and Internet access is a privilege granted by management and may be revoked\n\nat any time for inappropriate conduct carried out on such systems, including, but not limited to:\n\n•Sending chain letters or participating in any way in the creation or transmission of unsolicited \"spam\" that is\n\nunrelated to legitimate Company purposes;\n\n•Engaging in private or personal business activities, including excessive use of instant messaging and chat\n\nrooms;\n\n•Accessing networks, servers, drives, folders, or files to which the employee has not been granted access or\n\nauthorization from someone with the right to make such a grant;\n\n•Making unauthorized copies of Company files or other Company data;\n\n•Destroying, deleting, erasing, or concealing Company files or other Company data, or otherwise making such\n\nfiles or data unavailable or inaccessible to the Company or to other authorized users of Company systems;\n\n•Misrepresenting oneself or the Company;\n\n•Violating the laws and regulations of federal, state, city, province, or local jurisdictions in any way;\n\n•Engaging in unlawful or malicious activities;\n\n•Deliberately propagating any virus, worm, Trojan horse, trap-door program code, or other code or file\n\ndesigned to disrupt, disable, impair, or otherwise harm either the Company's networks or systems or those of\n\nany other individual or entity;\n\n•Using abusive, profane, threatening, racist, sexist, or otherwise objectionable language in either public or\n\nprivate messages;\n\n•Sending, receiving, or accessing pornographic materials;\n\n\n\n•Causing congestion, disruption, disablement, alteration, or impairment of Company networks or systems;\n\n•Using recreational games; and/or\n\n•Defeating or attempting to defeat security restrictions on company systems and applications.\n\nSuch access will be discontinued upon termination of employment, completion of contract, end of service of non-\n\nemployee, or disciplinary action arising from violation of this policy. In the case of a change in job function and/or\n\ntransfer, the original access code will be discontinued, and only reissued if necessary and a new access request is\n\napproved.\n\nAll user IDs that have been inactive for thirty (30) days will be revoked. The privileges granted to users must be\n\nreevaluated by management annually. In response to feedback from management, systems administrators must\n\npromptly revoke all privileges no longer needed by users.\n\nTeleworking\n\nRequirements\n\n•Secure remote access must be strictly controlled with encryption and strong pass-phrases. Refer to the\n\nEncryption Policyand thePassword Policyfor further information.\n\n•Authorized Users must protect their login and password, without exception.\n\n•While using an Asolvi AS-owned computer to remotely connect to the company's network, authorized users\n\nmust ensure the remote host is not connected to any other network at the same time, except personal networks\n\nthat are under their complete control or under the complete control of an authorized user or third party.\n\n•The most up-to-date antivirus software must be used on all computers. Third-party connections must comply\n\nwith requirements as stated in the Vendor Management Agreement.\n\n•Equipment used to connect to Asolvi AS's networks must meet the requirements for remote access and device\n\nuse as stated in theAcceptable Use Policy,Asset Management Policy, andSystem Access Control Policy.\n\nRemote Access Tools\n\nAll remote access tools used to communicate between Asolvi AS assets and other systems must comply with the\n\nfollowing policy requirements:\n\n•Multi-factor authentication (such as authentication tokens and smart cards that require an additional PIN or\n\npassword) is required for all remote access tools\n\n•The authentication database source must be Active Directory or LDAP, and the authentication protocol must\n\ninvolve a challenge-response protocol that is not susceptible to replay attacks.

This\n\npertains to all devices that connect to the company network, regardless of ownership. Mobile endpoint and storage\n\ndevices are defined to include: desktop systems (in a telework environment), laptops, PDAs, mobile phones, plug-ins,\n\nUniversal Serial Bus (USB) port devices, Compact Discs (CDs), Digital Versatile Discs (DVDs), flash drives, modems,\n\nhandheld wireless devices, wireless networking cards, and any other existing or future mobile computing or storage\n\ndevice, either personally owned or Asolvi AS owned. An inventory of company-owned assets will be properly\n\nmaintained.\n\nFor endpoint devices,\n\n\n\n•Company-issued mobile devices will have antivirus and endpoint security pre-installed.\n\n•Users must run an online malware scanner at least once a month.\n\n•If browser add-ons are approved and installed, a browser testing tool shall be run to ensure the security of the\n\nadd-on.\n\n•Mobile endpoint devices must further meet the requirements for use as stated in theAcceptable Use Policy\n\nandAsset Management Policy.\n\nFor storage devices,\n\n•A risk analysis will be conducted before the use or connection to the company network unless previously\n\napproved.\n\n•Detection of incidents must immediately be reported to the information security team.\n\n•Stolen mobile devices must immediately be reported to the information security team.\n\nIntellectual Property Rights\n\nAsolvi AS takes handling and safeguarding of intellectual property very seriously. Intellectual property rights include\n\nsoftware or document copyright, design rights, trademarks, patents, and source code licenses.\n\nTo ensure this the following procedures will be maintained:\n\n•The software will only be acquired through known and reputable sources, to ensure that copyright is not\n\nviolated.\n\n•An asset inventory will identify all assets with requirements to protect intellectual property rights.\n\n•Proof and evidence of ownership of licenses, master disks, manuals, etc. will be maintained.\n\n•A review of the asset inventory will also make sure that only software and licensed products are installed.\n\n•Will ensure compliance with terms and conditions for software and information obtained from public\n\nnetworks\n\nCustomers\n\nWhen using cloud services, additional procedures will be in place to identify any licensing requirements specific to\n\ncloud deployment. This is crucial as installing commercially licensed software in a cloud service may inadvertently\n\nbreach the terms of the software license. This procedure will give particular attention to scenarios where the cloud\n\nservice features are elastic and scalable, which may result in the software being used on more systems or processor\n\ncores than is permitted by the license terms.\n\nCloud Service Providers\n\nAsolvi AS will have an established process for responding to intellectual property rights complaints, ensuring the\n\nprotection of proprietary assets.\n\nInformation Security Requirements Analysis & Specifications\n\nAsolvi AS will identify its information security requirements by utilizing different methods, ensure the results of the\n\nidentification are documented and reviewed by all stakeholders, and will integrate the requirements and associated\n\nprocesses in the early stages of projects.\n\nMethods\n\n•Policies and regulations\n\n•Threat modeling\n\n•Incident reviews\n\n•Use of vulnerability thresholds\n\n\n\nFactors\n\n•Level of confidence required towards the claimed identity of users, to derive user authentication requirements.\n\n•Access provisioning and authorization processes, for business and privileged or technical users.\n\n•Informing users and operators of their duties and responsibilities.\n\n•Protection needs of assets, especially in terms of availability, confidentiality, and integrity.\n\n•Business processes (e.g., transaction logging and monitoring, non-repudiation requirements).\n\n•Other security controls (e.g. interfaces to logging and monitoring or data leakage detection systems).\n\nEmployment Terms and Conditions\n\nThe following terms and conditions of employment at Asolvi AS are the contractual obligations for employees or\n\ncontractors for the safeguarding of information. They include, but are not limited to:\n\n•Signing a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement (NDA) before access to confidential information and\n\nprocessing facilities.\n\n•Legal responsibilities and rights, particularly concerning intellectual property.\n\n•Responsibilities for the classification of information and management of organizational assets associated with\n\ninformation, information processing facilities, and information services handled by an employee or contractor.\n\n•Responsibilities for the handling of information received from third parties.\n\n•Reviewing and agreeing with the security policies of the company.\n\n•Duration of responsibilities beyond the end of employment.\n\n•Actions to be taken for non-compliance with the terms and conditions, and the company's security policies.\n\nDisciplinary Process\n\nAsolvi AS's discipline policy and procedures are designed to provide a structured corrective action process to improve\n\nand prevent a recurrence of undesirable employee behavior and performance issues. It has been designed to be\n\nconsistent with Asolvi AS cultural values, Human Resources (HR) best practices, and employment laws.\n\nAsolvi AS reserves the right to combine or skip steps depending on the facts of each situation and the nature of the\n\noffense. The level of disciplinary intervention may also vary. Some of the factors that will be considered are whether\n\nthe offense is repeated despite coaching, counseling, or training, the employee's work record, and the impact the\n\nconduct and performance issues have on the organization.\n\nStep 1: Verbal Warning and Counseling\n\nThis initial step creates an opportunity for the immediate supervisor to schedule a meeting with an employee to bring\n\nattention to an existing performance, conduct, or attendance issue. The supervisor should discuss with the employee the\n\nnature of the problem or the violation of company policies and procedures. The supervisor is expected to clearly\n\ndescribe expectations and the steps the employee must take to improve performance or resolve the problem.\n\nStep 2: Formal Written Warning\n\nIf the employee does not promptly correct any performance, conduct or attendance issues that were identified in Step 1,\n\na written warning will become formal documentation of the performance, conduct, or attendance issues and\n\nconsequences. The employee will sign a copy of the document to acknowledge receipt and understanding of the formal\n\nwarning. During Step 2, the immediate supervisor and HR representative will meet with the employee to review any\n\nadditional incidents or information about the performance, conduct, or attendance issues as well as any prior relevant\n\ncorrective action plans. Management will outline the consequences for the employee of his or her continued failure to\n\nmeet performance or conduct expectations.\n\nA formal performance improvement plan (PIP) requiring the employee's immediate and sustained corrective action will\n\nbe issued after a Step 2 meeting. A warning outlining that the employee may be subject to additional discipline up to\n\nand including termination if immediate and sustained corrective action is not taken may also be included in the written\n\n\n\nwarning.\n\nStep 3: Suspension and Final Written Warning\n\nThere may be performance, conduct, or safety incidents so problematic and harmful that the most effective action may\n\nbe the temporary removal of the employee from the workplace. When immediate action is necessary to ensure the\n\nsafety of the employee or others, the immediate supervisor may suspend the employee pending the results of an\n\ninvestigation. Suspensions that are recommended as part of the normal progression of this progressive discipline policy\n\nand procedure are subject to approval from a next-level manager and HR.\n\nStep 4: Recommendation for Termination of Employment\n\nThe last step in the progressive discipline procedure is a recommendation to terminate employment. Generally, Asolvi\n\nAS will try to exercise the progressive nature of this policy by first providing warnings, a final written warning or\n\nsuspension from the workplace before proceeding to a recommendation to terminate employment. However, Asolvi As\n\nreserves the right to combine and skip steps depending on the circumstances of each situation and the nature of the\n\noffense. Furthermore, employees may be terminated without prior notice or disciplinary action.\n\nManagement's recommendation to terminate employment must be approved by HR and the supervisor's immediate\n\nmanager. Final approval may be required from the CEO.\n\nPerformance and Conduct Issues Not Subject to Progressive Discipline\n\nIllegal behavior is not subject to progressive discipline, and such behavior may be reported to local law enforcement\n\nauthorities. Theft, substance abuse, intoxication, fighting, and other acts of violence at work are grounds for immediate\n\ntermination.\n\nEnforcement\n\nAsolvi AS Management, under the explicit authority granted by the company CEO, retains the authority and\n\nresponsibility to monitor and enforce compliance with this Policy and other policies, standards, procedures, and\n\nguidelines.

These \n\nlogs must provide sufficient detail to answer the following questions:\n\nWhat activity was performed?\n\nWho performed the activity?\n\nWhere, when, and how was it performed (including the tools used)?\n\nWhat was the status, outcome, or result of the activity?\n\nBy ensuring that logs capture this information, the company enhances its ability to monitor, review, and respond to security events, ensuring \n\nthe integrity and security of its systems.\n\n3.2 Logged Activities\n\nLog records must be created for the following activities:\n\n\n\nSensitive Information Access:\n\nAttempts to create, read, update, or delete sensitive information, including confidential authentication data such as passwords.\n\nNetwork Connections:\n\nInitiating or accepting a network connection.\n\nUser Authentication and Authorization:\n\nUser login and logout, as well as any changes to access rights.\n\nInvalid Logical Access Attempts:\n\nAll unauthorized or failed logical access attempts.\n\nAdministrative Actions:\n\nAll actions performed by individuals with administrative or elevated privileges.\n\nAttempts to grant, modify, or revoke access rights (e.g., adding a new user or group, changing user privilege levels, modifying file or \n\ndatabase permissions).\n\nChanges to firewall rules, user privileges, and database object permissions.\n\nModifications of administrative access, including user password changes and elevation of privileges.\n\nAudit Log Access:\n\nAll access to audit logs, including actions such as starting, stopping, or pausing audit logs.\n\nSystem-Level Changes:\n\nCreation and deletion of system-level objects.\n\nChanges in system, network, or services configuration, including the installation of software patches, updates, or other installed \n\nsoftware modifications.\n\nSystem Events:\n\nApplication and process events, such as startup, shutdown, or restart.\n\nApplication process failure, abnormal termination, or resource exhaustion (e.g., CPU, memory, network bandwidth, disk space).\n\nFailures of critical services (e.g., DHCP, DNS), hardware faults, or hardware malfunctions.\n\nDetection of Suspicious/Malicious Activity:\n\nDetection and logging of potential security threats, including alerts from intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention \n\nsystems (IPS), web application firewalls, anti-malware systems, or anti-spyware tools.\n\nBy capturing these logged activities, the company ensures full visibility into system operations and enhances the ability to respond to \n\npotential security incidents or system malfunctions.\n\n3.3 Log Elements\n\nEach log must identify or contain the following elements to ensure thorough audit trails and log correlation where feasible (content may \n\ndepend on system):\n\nType of Action      The specific action performed, such as authorize, create, read, update, delete, or network connection \n\ninitiation. Includes whether the action was successful or failed. \n\nSubsystem           The process or transaction name responsible for performing the action. Examples include a system \n\nservice or application transaction. \n\nIdentifiers         Identifying information for the subject requesting the action, such as user name, computer name, IP \n\naddress, MAC address. These identifiers should be standardized for easy correlation. \n\nObject of Action    Identifies what the action was performed on, such as file names accessed, records from a database, or \n\nspecific network resources affected. \n\nElementDescription\n\n\n\nThis structured approach ensures that logs provide comprehensive visibility into system activities, enabling effective monitoring, auditing, \n\nand security investigations.\n\n3.4 Clock Synchronization\n\nTo ensure the accuracy of system logs, all system clocks must be synchronized using time-synchronization technology. The following \n\nrequirements are mandatory for maintaining the integrity and consistency of audit logs:\n\nTime Source: Logs must rely on accurate time sources, either International Atomic Time (TAI) or Coordinated Universal Time \n\n(UTC), to ensure uniformity across systems.\n\nNetwork Time Protocol (NTP): All servers and critical infrastructure must use NTP to synchronize their clocks with a central time server. \n\nThis ensures that the timestamps in audit logs are consistent across the environment.\n\nTime Synchronization Settings:\n\nAccess Control: Time synchronization settings will be restricted to authorized personnel only. Changes to the time settings must be \n\nlimited to those with a business need and appropriate permissions.\n\nLogging Changes: Any modification to time settings on critical systems must be logged, including details of the personnel making \n\nthe change and the reason for it.\n\nMonitoring: System logs must be continuously monitored to ensure that no unauthorized or unintended changes to the time settings \n\noccur. Any detected discrepancies will be flagged and reviewed.\n\nAuditing and Review: Regular reviews of time synchronization settings and logs will be conducted to detect any drift or misalignment in \n\ntime stamps, ensuring the accuracy of all logged events.\n\nThis synchronization mechanism helps ensure that all log entries are recorded with accurate and consistent timestamps, which is essential \n\nfor auditing, investigations, and compliance reporting.\n\n3.5 Protection of Audit Logs\n\nTo ensure the integrity and security of audit logs, the following controls will be implemented to safeguard logs from tampering by individuals \n\nwith elevated access or unauthorized users:\n\nAccess Control:\n\nRestricted Access: Read access to audit logs will be strictly limited to personnel with a job-related need. Only authorized \n\nindividuals responsible for monitoring or auditing system activity will be granted this access.\n\nAdministrator Restrictions: System administrators will be restricted from erasing, deactivating, or modifying logs of their own \n\nactivities if possible. This ensures transparency and accountability for administrative actions.\n\nBackup:\n\nCentralized Backup: All audit log files, including those related to external-facing technologies, will be backed up to a secure, \n\ncentralized internal log server or other secure media. These backups will be stored outside the direct control of system \n\nadministrators to prevent manipulation.\n\nRedundancy and Availability: Logs must be backed up on a regular basis, with redundancy measures in place to ensure log \n\navailability during recovery from failures or security incidents.\n\nBefore/After Values When applicable and feasible, records the before and after values of data elements that are updated as \n\npart of the action. \n\nDate and Time       The exact date and time the action was performed, including relevant time-zone information. For \n\nconsistency, logs should use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) when possible. \n\nAccess Control Outcome Whether the action was allowed or denied by the system's access control mechanisms. \n\nAccess Control Reason  In the event the action is denied, logs should contain descriptions or reason codes explaining why it \n\nwas blocked. \n\n\n\nFile Integrity Monitoring:\n\nChange Detection: A file integrity monitoring (FIM) or change-detection mechanism will be employed to monitor and protect audit \n\nlogs (where feasible based on system criticality, design and requirements). Any unauthorized or unexpected changes to the logs must \n\ngenerate real-time alerts.\n\nContinuous Monitoring: All log data will be subjected to continuous monitoring, with alerts configured to detect suspicious or \n\nmalicious activities targeting audit logs.\n\nReview and Accountability:\n\nPeriodic Reviews: Logs related to privileged user activities, including system administrators and operators, will be reviewed \n\nregularly to ensure compliance with security policies and detect any misuse or unauthorized actions.\n\nAccountability: All activities carried out by privileged users (e.g., system administrators) will be logged. These logs will be reviewed \n\nby security personnel and subjected to routine audits to maintain accountability.\n\nPrivileged Operations Logging:\n\nDelegated Operations: In instances where privileged operations have been delegated to the company by third parties or customers, \n\nthe performance of these operations will be logged and safeguarded. This ensures that all privileged actions are traceable and can \n\nbe audited when necessary.\n\nBy implementing these protections, the integrity and availability of audit logs are maintained, ensuring they provide reliable evidence for \n\naudits, investigations, and security monitoring.\n\n3.6 Monitoring\n\nFailures in critical security control systems must be detected, alerted, and resolved promptly to maintain the integrity of the company's \n\ninfrastructure. The systems that must be monitored include:\n\nNetwork Security Controls: \n\nIntrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): Monitors network traffic for suspicious activities and responds to threats.\n\nFirewalls: Ensures unauthorized network traffic is blocked, with real-time monitoring of firewall rule changes and suspicious \n\nconnection attempts.\n\nAccess Controls: \n\nPhysical Access Controls: Monitoring systems that track and alert on unauthorized physical access to sensitive areas such as data \n\ncenters (not applicable for cloud environment, maintained by cloud provider).\n\nLogical Access Controls: Ensuring that login attempts, failed logins, privilege escalations, and other access control mechanisms \n\nare actively monitored and alerting for unauthorized attempts.\n\nAudit Logs: \n\nAutomated Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of audit logs to detect anomalies, security breaches, and policy violations.\n\nPeriodic Reviews: Manual review of logs by authorized personnel to ensure adherence to company security policies and standards.\n\nChange Detection Mechanisms: \n\nFile Integrity Monitoring: Tracks and alerts on unauthorized changes to critical system files, configurations, and security settings.\n\nSystem Configuration Monitoring: Detects any unsanctioned system changes, such as unauthorized software installations or \n\nmisconfigurations.\n\nAnti-malware Solutions: \n\nThreat Detection: Continuous monitoring for malware infections, suspicious activity, and potential threats across systems, with \n\nautomatic alerts and incident reporting.\n\nFailures identified within any of these critical control systems must be addressed promptly in accordance with the incident response \n\npolicy. Actions include:\n\nRestoring Security Functions:\n\nSecurity functions must be immediately restored to minimize downtime and prevent further damage or compromise.\n\nDocumenting the Failure:\n\n\n\nDuration: Accurately recording the start and end times of the security failure.\n\nCause Identification: Investigating the root cause of the failure and documenting it comprehensively.\n\nAddressing Security Issues:\n\nImpact Assessment: Identifying and addressing any security risks or vulnerabilities exposed by the failure.\n\nRemediation: Implementing immediate fixes to resolve the issues, whether it is through patching, reconfiguring, or updating systems.\n\nEvaluating Future Risk:\n\nPreventative Actions: Implementing controls or improvements to prevent the reoccurrence of the failure.\n\nResuming Monitoring: Ensuring that the affected systems and controls are returned to full monitoring status to continue \n\nsafeguarding against future incidents.\n\nIncident Reporting:\n\nSecurity incidents resulting from control failures must be logged, reported, and shared with relevant stakeholders, including IT and \n\nsecurity teams, ensuring transparency and prompt action.\n\nBy enforcing continuous monitoring and establishing robust incident response mechanisms, the company ensures that failures in security \n\ncontrols are detected and addressed efficiently to minimize the impact on its operations and data security.\n\n4 Document Administration\n\n4.1 Ownership and Review\n\n  \n\n4.2 Monitoring and Enforcement\n\n4.3 Related Documents\n\n4.3.1 Internal documents\n\nInformation Security Policy \n\nInformation Security Organization Policy\n\nChange Management Policy \n\nConfiguration Management Plan  \n\n4.4 Approvals\n\nThe Document Owner owns this Document and is responsible for reviewing the Document for updates annually, or following any major \n\nchanges to Squirro AG's compliance environment.

The frequency of these tests will be based on business needs, regulatory \n\nrequirements, or after major changes to the system infrastructure.\n\nAnalysis of Findings: The findings from vulnerability scans and penetration tests will be thoroughly reviewed by the Security Officer, in \n\ncollaboration with IT and Engineering teams. The analysis will focus on identifying actionable vulnerabilities, prioritizing them based on \n\nseverity, and determining appropriate remediation steps.\n\nReporting and Resolution: The findings will be reported through the established security reporting process. Each vulnerability identified \n\nwill be documented, prioritized, and tracked until its resolution, following the company's defined Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for \n\naddressing security issues.\n\nRegular penetration testing, combined with thorough analysis and prompt resolution of identified vulnerabilities, is essential to maintaining \n\nthe security and resilience of the company's systems and infrastructure.\n\n\n\n3.4 Security Findings Reporting, Tracking, and Remediation\n\nThe company follows a streamlined vulnerability tracking process using Jira. All identified security findings, such as vulnerabilities in \n\nsoftware, systems, or processes, are tracked to resolution to ensure comprehensive remediation.\n\nReporting a Finding: Upon the identification of a vulnerability, a Jira ticket is created. This ticket includes a description of the finding, \n\nfurther details without any confidential information, and a link to the source of the issue.\n\nPriority Assignment: Each finding will be assigned a priority level within Jira based on its severity and potential impact on the \n\ncompany's systems and operations. The following priority levels are used:\n\nCritical\n\nHigh\n\nMedium\n\nLow\n\nTracking and Retention: The records of all findings are retained in Jira for a minimum period of 3 years, ensuring that the findings are \n\ndocumented for future audits, reviews, or follow-ups.\n\nRemediation Process: Once a finding is identified and recorded, it will be assigned to the owner responsible for the affected system or \n\nsoftware package. The assignee is responsible for addressing the finding according to the established Service Level Agreements \n\n(SLAs). Remediation can be completed through:\n\nImplementing a valid fix or mitigation.\n\nDetermining the finding is a false positive.\n\nDocumenting an approved exception when a fix is not feasible.\n\nValidation and Closure: After remediation, the finding is reassigned to the reporter or a member of the security team for validation. If \n\nvalidated, the finding is marked as closed in Jira. Fixes must be deployed to a development environment and have a targeted release \n\ndate for production deployment.\n\nThe company uses Jira to track and manage security vulnerabilities. All findings are reported, prioritized, and tracked to ensure they are \n\nremediated promptly, ensuring the security of the company's systems and data.\n\n3.5 Reporting a Finding\n\nUpon the identification of a vulnerability (whether in software, systems, or processes), a Jira ticket will be created.\n\nTicket Creation: A Jira ticket must be opened to record the vulnerability. This ticket acts as the primary means of documenting and \n\ntracking the issue through its lifecycle.\n\nDescription: The description of the finding should include comprehensive details about the vulnerability, while ensuring no confidential \n\ninformation is included. The description should provide a clear understanding of the issue and, where applicable, a link to the source of \n\nthe finding.\n\nPriority Assignment: The finding will be assigned a priority level in Jira based on its severity and potential impact. These levels include:\n\nCritical\n\nHigh\n\nMedium\n\nLow\n\nAll identified vulnerabilities are documented in Jira, with appropriate details and a priority level assigned. This process ensures \n\nvulnerabilities are properly tracked from discovery to remediation.\n\n3.6 Priority/Severity Ratings and Service Level Agreements\n\nIn order to address security vulnerabilities efficiently, the company has established the following timelines (Service Level Agreements - \n\nSLAs) for different priority levels. Each level is defined by its impact and specific examples.\n\nPriority LevelSLADescriptionImpactExamples\n\n\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities are categorized by their priority, with defined SLAs to ensure prompt resolution. The priority may change based on \n\nnew findings, which will adjust the response timeline accordingly.\n\n3.7 Priority Updates\n\nThe management of security vulnerabilities includes the flexibility to adjust priorities based on new information or a better understanding of \n\nthe impact and likelihood of exploitation. As a result, the following processes are applied when a priority is either upgraded or downgraded:\n\nPriority Upgrade: When new information or an increased threat is identified, the priority of a vulnerability may be upgraded (e.g., from \n\nMedium to High or Critical). In such cases, the SLA is reset, starting from the moment the escalation was made. This ensures that \n\nmore immediate attention is given to the vulnerability, and remediation efforts are accelerated based on its new urgency. The goal is to \n\nreflect the increased risk posed by the vulnerability and address it as quickly as possible.\n\nPriority Downgrade: When further analysis reveals that a vulnerability poses less risk than initially assessed, the priority may be \n\ndowngraded (e.g., from Critical to Medium). In this situation, the SLA remains unchanged and continues to follow the original timeline \n\nestablished when the vulnerability was first identified. This ensures that there is no undue delay in remediation, while still allowing for \n\nlower-priority vulnerabilities to be resolved within a more appropriate timeframe.\n\nThese updates help ensure that vulnerabilities are treated with the appropriate level of urgency and that remediation timelines remain \n\naligned with the evolving threat landscape.\n\n3.8 Resolving a Finding\n\nThe process for resolving a vulnerability finding is structured to ensure proper accountability and timely remediation. The following steps \n\noutline how findings should be handled:\n\nAssignment of Ownership: Each finding must be assigned to the owner responsible for the system, software package, or component \n\nwhere the vulnerability exists. The owner is accountable for ensuring that the finding is addressed appropriately.\n\nAddressing Findings Within SLAs: All findings must be resolved according to the established Service Level Agreements (SLAs) based \n\non the severity and priority level of the vulnerability. It is crucial that these timelines are adhered to, ensuring vulnerabilities are \n\nCritical 24-48 hoursImmediate action required; vulnerabilities \n\nthat pose an imminent threat, such as \n\nremote code execution, data theft, or \n\nadmin privilege escalation. These must be \n\naddressed as a top priority to prevent \n\nsevere impact.\n\nVulnerabilities causing \n\nprivilege escalation to \n\nadmin, remote code \n\nexecution, financial theft, \n\nunauthorized access, or \n\ndata extraction. \n\nRCE, Vertical \n\nAuthentication Bypass, \n\nSSRF, XXE, SQL Injection, \n\nUser Authentication \n\nBypass. \n\nHigh 3-7 daysHigh-risk vulnerabilities that could \n\nseriously affect security or business \n\noperations, but are less urgent than critical \n\nvulnerabilities. They still require swift \n\naction to prevent exploitation.\n\nVulnerabilities affecting \n\nthe platform's security \n\nand processes. \n\nLateral Authentication \n\nBypass, Stored XSS, some \n\nCSRF depending on \n\nimpact. \n\nMedium 15-30 daysModerate vulnerabilities that pose a risk \n\nbut require specific conditions to exploit, \n\nsuch as user interaction or specific \n\nconfigurations. These should be resolved \n\nwithin a month.\n\nVulnerabilities affecting \n\nmultiple users, requiring \n\nminimal user interaction \n\nto trigger. \n\nReflective XSS, Direct \n\nObject Reference, URL \n\nRedirect, some CSRF \n\ndepending on impact. \n\nLow 30-90 daysLow-risk vulnerabilities with minimal impact \n\nor requiring significant effort to exploit. \n\nThese can be addressed over a longer \n\nperiod but should still be tracked and \n\nresolved.\n\nIssues affecting singular \n\nusers, requiring \n\nsignificant interaction or \n\nprerequisites (e.g., MitM \n\nattacks). \n\nCommon flaws, Debug \n\nInformation, Mixed \n\nContent. \n\n\n\nremediated in a timely manner to minimize risks.\n\nRestrictions on Deployment: No software should be deployed to the production environment if it contains unresolved Critical or High \n\nfindings. An exception to this policy may be granted only if an approved Exception is in place, detailing compensating controls or \n\nacceptable risks for the specific case.\n\nResolution Methods: A vulnerability finding may be resolved by one of the following methods:\n\nFix/Mitigation: Providing and implementing a valid fix or mitigation that effectively addresses the identified vulnerability.\n\nFalse Positive: Determining that the finding is a false positive after proper validation, meaning the issue does not pose a real \n\nsecurity risk.\n\nApproved Exception: Documenting an approved exception, where a viable or immediate fix is not available, but compensating \n\ncontrols are in place to mitigate the risk.\n\nThis structured process ensures that vulnerabilities are systematically addressed, and that the organization remains protected from potential \n\nsecurity threats.\n\n3.9 Closing a Finding\n\nOnce a vulnerability finding has been addressed, the following steps must be followed to ensure proper closure:\n\nResolution and Comment: The assignee responsible for addressing the finding must provide a valid resolution, such as a fix, \n\nmitigation, or documented exception. A comment should be added to the finding in the tracking system detailing the resolution process.\n\nReassignment for Validation: After resolution, the finding should be re-assigned to the original Reporter or a designated member of the \n\nsecurity team for validation. This step ensures that the solution is reviewed and confirmed to have addressed the identified vulnerability.\n\nMarking the Finding as Closed: Upon successful validation by the security team or reporter, the finding can be marked as \"Done\" or \n\nclosed in the tracking system. However, before the finding is officially closed, the implemented fix must be deployed to a development \n\nenvironment for testing.\n\nProduction Release Planning: The final step before closure requires that the targeted release date for deploying the fix to the \n\nproduction environment is documented in the ticket. This ensures transparency and allows for tracking when the fix will be fully \n\nimplemented.\n\nThis process ensures that findings are not only resolved but also validated and tracked through to deployment, ensuring the security of \n\nsystems and compliance with internal standards.\n\n3.10 Exceptions\n\nIn certain cases, a viable or direct fix to a vulnerability may not be available. When this occurs, an Exception can be requested following the \n\nguidelines below:\n\nWhen to Request an Exception: An Exception may be necessary if the package version containing the fix is not supported on the \n\ncurrent operating system or if the fix introduces other technical constraints. \n\nCompensating Controls: In lieu of a direct fix, an alternative solution or compensating control must be implemented to mitigate the risk \n\nposed by the vulnerability. Compensating controls can be technical solutions or procedural changes and must address the original \n\nvulnerability effectively to lower the associated risk to an acceptable level.\n\nException Submission: The Exception must be formally requested through the tracking system (e.g., Jira) by creating a ticket \n\nspecifically for the Exception. The Exception ticket should include detailed information about why the vulnerability cannot be directly \n\naddressed, and a description of the compensating controls in place.\n\nReference to the Original Finding: The Exception ticket must be linked to the original vulnerability Finding by adding an Issue Link in \n\nthe tracking system, ensuring a clear connection between the two items.\n\nReview and Approval: Each Exception request must undergo a thorough review process. The Security Officer and the asset owner \n\nimpacted by the vulnerability must review and approve the Exception before it can be implemented. This ensures that the alternative \n\nsolution provides sufficient security and risk mitigation.\n\n\n\nThis structured approach ensures that all Exceptions are adequately documented, reviewed, and monitored, providing a controlled process \n\nfor managing vulnerabilities when a direct fix is not feasible.\n\n3.11 Malware Protection\n\nThe company will implement an anti-malware solution on all identified endpoints and system components at risk for malware. The anti-\n\nmalware solution will follow these guidelines:\n\nDetection and Removal: The anti-malware solution will be configured to detect all known types of malware and take appropriate \n\nactions, including removal, blocking, or containment of the malware to prevent damage or infection to company systems.\n\nAutomatic Updates: The anti-malware solution will be kept up-to-date automatically to ensure the system can defend against newly \n\nidentified threats.\n\nPeriodic and Real-Time Scanning: The anti-malware software will perform periodic scans and will continuously monitor the system via \n\nactive or real-time scanning. If behavioral analysis is implemented, it will monitor system processes for suspicious activities.\n\nRemovable Media Scans: When removable electronic media (e.g., USB drives) is inserted, connected, or logically mounted, the anti-\n\nmalware solution will automatically scan it for potential threats. If continuous behavioral analysis is enabled, the system will analyze the \n\nmedia for malware or other suspicious behavior throughout its use.\n\nAudit Logging: The anti-malware system will generate and retain audit logs of all malware scans, detections, and responses for a \n\nminimum period of 12 months. These logs will ensure traceability and monitoring of malware-related events.\n\nAccess Control: Configuration modifications to the anti-malware solution will be restricted to authorized personnel only. Regular users \n\nwill not be permitted to disable or alter the anti-malware protection mechanisms, except under specific circumstances where \n\nmanagement has documented and authorized an exception for a limited time.\n\nThe malware protection system will ensure comprehensive security by automating updates, scanning, and behavioral analysis. Controls \n\nover access to the anti-malware system will prevent unauthorized modifications, and audit logs will track system performance over time.\n\n3.12 Phishing Protection\n\nThe company will implement processes and automated mechanisms to detect and protect against phishing attacks aimed at personnel and \n\nsystems. The following measures will be included:\n\nEmail Security Protocols: Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) and DomainKeys Identified \n\nMail (DKIM) will be deployed to authenticate email origins and ensure that incoming emails are from trusted sources.\n\nLink Scrubbers: Automated systems will be used to scrub links within emails and web pages to detect and block malicious or suspicious \n\nURLs that may lead to phishing websites.\n\nServer-Side Antivirus: Server-side antivirus solutions will be used to scan emails and attachments before they reach user inboxes, \n\nreducing the risk of phishing and malware.\n\nContinuous Monitoring: Phishing detection systems will be continuously monitored to identify and respond to phishing attempts in real \n\ntime. Alerts and responses will be configured to mitigate risk and prevent users from interacting with phishing content.\n\nThe company will proactively guard against phishing attempts through automated email security protocols, link scrubbing technologies, and \n\nserver-side antivirus solutions. These mechanisms ensure the detection and mitigation of phishing threats before they reach personnel, \n\nenhancing overall cybersecurity.\n\n4 Document Administration\n\n4.1 Ownership and Review\n\n \n\nThe Document Owner owns this Document and is responsible for reviewing the Document for updates annually, or following any major \n\nchanges to Squirro AG's compliance environment.

The process consists of four parts: identification of the \n\ncompany's assets, as well as the threats and vulnerabilities that apply; assessment of the likelihood and consequence (risk) of the threats \n\nand vulnerabilities being realized, identification of treatment for each unacceptable risk, and evaluation of the residual risk after treatment.\n\n3.1 Risk Assessment\n\nThe company follows a comprehensive risk assessment process to identify, evaluate, and manage risks related to company assets. This \n\nprocess ensures appropriate controls and treatment measures are applied to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.\n\nAsset Identification: All assets within the scope of the information security program are identified, including documents \n\n(paper/electronic), applications, databases, IT equipment, infrastructure, and external services. Each asset is assigned an owner.\n\nThreat and Vulnerability Identification: Threats and vulnerabilities for each asset are documented in a risk assessment table. Multiple \n\nthreats and vulnerabilities may be associated with a single asset.\n\nRisk Ownership: A risk owner is assigned to each identified risk. The risk owner may also be the asset owner.\n\nRisk Assessment: The risk owner evaluates the impact and likelihood for each combination of threats and vulnerabilities. Impact and \n\nlikelihood are measured based on predefined criteria, and the risk level is calculated by multiplying the impact score and likelihood score.\n\nThe risk assessment process provides a structured method to identify risks, assign ownership, and determine the severity of risks to \n\ncompany assets.\n\n3.2 Risk Assessment Process\n\n1. Asset Identification \n\nThe first step in the risk assessment process is to identify all assets within the scope of the company's information security program. \n\nThese assets may impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information within the organization. Assets can include:\n\nDocuments in paper or electronic form\n\nApplications, databases, and software\n\nInformation technology equipment (servers, computers, etc.)\n\nPhysical infrastructure (offices, data centers)\n\nExternal/outsourced services and processes\n\nEach asset must have an assigned owner responsible for managing its security.\n\n2. Threat and Vulnerability Identification \n\nFor each identified asset, potential threats and vulnerabilities must be documented. This includes any factors that could lead to \n\nunauthorized access, data breaches, or system failures. Threats and vulnerabilities must be compiled in a risk assessment table for \n\neasier tracking. Each asset can have multiple associated threats, and each threat can have multiple vulnerabilities.\n\n3. Risk Ownership \n\nFor every identified risk (a combination of threats and vulnerabilities), a risk owner must be assigned. This individual will be responsible \n\n\n\nfor managing and mitigating the risk. The risk owner may be the same individual as the asset owner.\n\n4. Risk Assessment Criteria \n\nOnce threats and vulnerabilities are identified, the risk owner assesses two key factors:\n\nImpact: The potential consequences if the threat exploits the vulnerability. The impact can range from minimal loss (e.g., local media \n\nattention) to extreme loss (e.g., massive financial loss, long-term international media coverage).\n\nLikelihood: The probability that the threat will exploit the vulnerability. This is typically rated on a scale from \"rare\" (once in 100+ \n\nyears) to \"certain\" (up to once every 2 years).\n\n5. Risk Level Calculation \n\nAfter determining the impact and likelihood of each risk, the overall risk level is calculated by multiplying the two scores. The risk level \n\nhelps prioritize risks and determines the need for treatment based on their severity.\n\n6. Risk Assessment Documentation \n\nAll findings from the assessment, including the assets, threats, vulnerabilities, and risk levels, are recorded in a Risk Assessment \n\nReport for future reference and review.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that all potential risks are thoroughly identified, assessed, and managed to protect the company's \n\ninformation and operational security.\n\n3.3 Risk Impact and Likelihood\n\nThis section defines the methodology used by the company to assess and quantify risks. Risks are measured based on two primary factors: \n\nimpact and likelihood. The impact measures the potential consequences of a risk, while likelihood evaluates how probable the risk is to \n\noccur. The combination of these two factors results in an overall risk score, which is then categorized into Low, Medium, or High risk levels. \n\nUnderstanding these criteria enables the organization to prioritize risk management efforts effectively.\n\n3.3.1 Impact\n\nThis table outlines the criteria for evaluating the impact of a risk. The impact level measures the severity of the consequences if a risk \n\nmaterializes, ranging from minimal to massive financial loss, reputational damage, regulatory issues, and customer dissatisfaction. These \n\nimpact levels help the company determine how critical a risk is and what actions are necessary to mitigate it.\n\n1 - IncidentalMinimal loss (<= CHF \n\n10'000) \n\nLocal media \n\nattention, quickly \n\nremedied \n\nNot reportable to \n\nregulator \n\nNo effect on \n\ncustomers, only \n\ninternal effects \n\nIsolated staff \n\ndissatisfaction \n\n2 - MinorMinor financial loss \n\n(CHF 10'000 - 50'000) \n\nLocal reputational \n\ndamage, minimal \n\nimpact \n\nReportable incident, \n\nno follow-up required \n\nCustomers affected \n\nwith minimal impact, \n\nno negative \n\nreputation \n\nGeneral morale \n\nproblems, slight \n\nturnover increase \n\n3 - ModerateModerate financial \n\nloss (CHF 50'000 - \n\n250'000) \n\nNational short-\n\nterm negative \n\nmedia coverage \n\nBreach report to \n\nregulator, immediate \n\ncorrection required \n\nCustomer annoyance, \n\nsome loss of \n\nconfidence \n\nWidespread morale \n\nproblems, high staff \n\nturnover \n\n4 - MajorSignificant financial \n\nloss (CHF 250'000 - \n\n500'000) \n\nNational long-term \n\nnegative media \n\ncoverage, market \n\nshare loss \n\nReport to regulator, \n\nmajor corrective \n\nproject needed \n\nStrongly affected \n\ncustomers, loss of \n\ntrust, multiple-week \n\nnegative publicity \n\nSenior management \n\nturnover, high \n\nexperienced staff \n\nturnover \n\n5 - ExtremeMassive financial loss \n\n(> CHF 500'000) \n\nInternational long-\n\nterm negative \n\nmedia, game-\n\nSignificant fines, \n\nlitigation, leadership \n\nprosecution \n\nCustomers severely \n\nimpacted (financially, \n\nMultiple senior \n\nleaders leave, severe \n\nstaff dissatisfaction \n\nImpact LevelFinancialReputationRegulatoryCustomerStaff\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Likelihood\n\nThe likelihood criteria evaluate the probability that a risk will occur. Likelihood is rated on a scale from Rare to Certain, based on the \n\nfrequency and probability of occurrence. Understanding the likelihood helps the company determine the frequency of potential risks and \n\nplan accordingly.\n\n3.3.3 Risk Criticality\n\nThe risk rating criteria combine the impact and likelihood values to calculate an overall risk score. This score helps categorize risks into \n\ndifferent levels: Low, Medium, or High. The risk score guides decision-making for prioritizing risk treatments and allocating resources for \n\nmitigation. \n\n3.4 Risk Score Matrix\n\nThe company uses a Risk Score Matrix to calculate risk levels based on the combination of impact and likelihood scores (multiplication).\n\nThe Risk Score Matrix provides a visual tool to categorize risks based on their combined impact and likelihood, ranging from Low to High.\n\nchanging market \n\nloss\n\nreputation-wise), \n\nlong-term loss of trust \n\n1 - RareOnce in 10 to 50 years (<2% chance of occurrence over the life of the company)\n\n2 - UnlikelyOnce in 5 to 10 years (2%-10% chance of occurrence over the life of the company)\n\n3 - PossibleOnce in 1 to 5 years (10%-20% chance of occurrence over the life of the company)\n\n4 - Likely1 time per year (20%-90% chance of occurrence over the life of the company)\n\n5 - CertainSeveral times per year (90-100% chance of occurrence over the life of the company)\n\nLikelihoodLikelihood\n\n1 - LowLess than or equal to 4\n\n2 - Medium Greater than 4 but less than or equal to 12\n\n3 - High Greater than 12\n\nRiskRisk Score\n\n1 - Incidental2 - Minor3 - Moderate4 - Major5 - Extreme\n\nLI\n\nKE\n\nLI\n\nHO\n\nOD\n\n1 - Rare1 - Low 2 - Low 3 - Low 4 - Low 5 - Medium \n\n2 - Unlikely2 - Low 4 - Low 6 - Medium 8 - Medium 10 - Medium \n\n3 - Possible3 - Low 6 - Medium 9 - Medium 12 - Medium 15 - High \n\n4 - Likely4 - Low 8 - Medium 12 - Medium 16 - High20 - High\n\n5 - Certain5 - Medium 10 - Medium 15 - High 20 - High25 - High\n\n IMPACT\n\n\n\n3.5 Risk Classification\n\nRisk classification involves identifying and categorizing potential risks that could affect the organization. It provides a structured way to \n\nassess different aspects of risks, including their nature, the actors involved, the assets and processes affected, and the timing of their \n\ndiscovery and occurrence. This helps the organization to develop appropriate responses and mitigation strategies.\n\nThe section is divided into the following categories:\n\nThreat Type: Describes the source or nature of the risks.\n\nActor: Identifies the internal or external entities activating/acting in the risk scenario.\n\nAsset/Process: Defines the critical assets or processes within the organization that could be impacted by risks.\n\nTime until Discovery: Describes how quickly the risk or incident is identified.\n\nTime of Occurrence: Evaluates the criticality of risks based on when they occur in business operations.\n\n3.5.1 Threat Type\n\nThis parameter categorizes different types of threats that the organization might face. These threats can arise from natural events, technical \n\nmalfunctions, organizational issues, human error, or malicious actions. Each threat type has distinct characteristics, requiring different \n\napproaches for risk management.\n\n3.5.2 Actor\n\nThis parameter identifies the actors that can cause or contribute to risks. Actors can be internal (within the organization) or external (outside \n\nthe organization). Understanding the sources of risks, whether they stem from employees or external factors like regulators or competitors, \n\nhelps in developing targeted risk mitigation strategies.\n\n3.5.3 Asset/Process\n\nThis parameter identifies the assets and processes that could be affected by risks. These include human resources, the organizational \n\nstructure, reputation, business processes, and IT infrastructure. By classifying these assets, the organization can better understand which \n\nForce majeureEarthquake, storm, flood—natural events beyond control that disrupt \n\noperations and infrastructure.\n\nTechnical IssueSoftware errors, technical failures, system overloads, environmental \n\nfactors affecting IT systems.\n\nOrganizational IssueDeficient processes or instructions, lack of documentation, insufficient \n\ninternal knowledge.\n\nUnintentional MishandlingHuman errors such as mistyping, mishandling, or failure to comply with \n\nregulations.\n\nIntentional ActionsDeliberate acts like sabotage, theft, malware, espionage, or social \n\nengineering.\n\nExternal RequirementChanges in laws or regulations that impose new compliance obligations.\n\nThreatDescription\n\nInternalEmployees, contractors, freelancers within the organization.\n\nExternalEntities outside the organization, such as regulators, business partners, or \n\ncompetitors.\n\nActorDescription\n\n\n\nareas are most vulnerable and require protection.\n\n3.5.4 Time until discovery\n\nThis parameter categorizes risks based on how quickly they are discovered after occurrence. The speed of discovery can have a significant \n\nimpact on the damage caused by the risk and the response needed. Some risks are detected immediately, while others may be found only \n\nafter a delay or by accident.\n\n3.5.5 Time of occurrence\n\nThis parameter categorizes risks based on when they occur relative to the organization's operational timeline. The criticality of a risk can \n\nvary depending on its timing, with some incidents having a severe impact if they occur at a crucial time, while others may have a minor \n\neffect if they occur during non-essential periods.\n\n3.6 Risk Remediation and Treatment\n\nRisk treatment refers to the process of deciding how to handle identified risks based on their potential impact and likelihood. There are four \n\nprimary approaches for addressing risks: Mitigate, Transfer, Avoid, and Accept. Each option depends on the organization's risk appetite, \n\nthe nature of the risk, and the cost-benefit analysis of implementing controls.\n\nHumanKnowledge and capabilities of personnel necessary for business operations.\n\nOrg. structureThe organizational structure defining management hierarchies and workflows.\n\nReputationThe organization's public image and trustworthiness.\n\nProcessThe business processes that are essential for delivering products or services.\n\nInfrastructureIT infrastructure, including hardware, software, and networking components.\n\nDevicesEnd-user devices such as laptops, printers, and workplace equipment.\n\nBusiness SupportApplications and services essential for supporting business operations (e.g., CRM, \n\nERP).\n\nInformationData and information required to execute business processes.\n\nAsset/ProcessDescription\n\nImmediateThe risk or incident is detected as it happens, allowing for an immediate response.\n\nWith delayThe risk or incident is discovered after a period of time, resulting in a delayed \n\nresponse.\n\nBy accidentThe risk or incident is discovered unintentionally, usually through unrelated activities.\n\nTimeDescription\n\nCriticalRisk or incident occurs during a crucial business period, such as year-end accounting \n\nfailures.\n\nNon-criticalRisk or incident occurs at a non-essential time, such as a one-day payroll system \n\noutage at the beginning of the month.\n\nTimeDescription\n\n\n\n3.6.1 Mitigate\n\nDeveloping or enhancing security controls to reduce the likelihood or impact of identified risks. These controls (measures) may be \n\ntechnological, procedural, physical, or people-focused in nature and are designed to manage risks to an acceptable level. Below are the \n\nkey types of security measures, grouped by category:\n\nTechnical: \n\nControls involving the use of technology to reduce risks. These include: controls like firewalls, encryption, and intrusion detection \n\nsystems designed to protect data, networks, and systems from cyber threats.\n\nProcedural: \n\nControls that govern how processes and tasks should be executed to mitigate risks. These include:\n\nGuidelines: Procedural instructions to guide behavior and decision-making in line with security standards.\n\nPolicy: Formal documents outlining security rules and practices to ensure compliance and proper governance.\n\nProcess: Standardized procedures, such as incident response or change management, that ensure tasks are performed consistently \n\nand securely.\n\nPhysical:\n\nControls that protect the organization's physical assets, environments, and infrastructure. These include: Access control systems: \n\nDevices such as biometric scanners, key cards, or PIN codes to control physical access to secure areas. Surveillance: Monitoring \n\nthrough cameras or security personnel to detect and respond to physical security breaches. Environmental controls: Systems like fire \n\nsuppression, temperature, and humidity control to protect data centers and critical infrastructure. Physical barriers: Locks, fences, \n\nsecurity gates, or other barriers to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive areas.\n\nPeople-focused: \n\nControls that focus on managing human factors in security. These include:\n\nPeople: Human-centric controls such as role-based access control and personnel management to ensure that employees are well-\n\nequipped to handle security responsibilities.\n\nTraining: Educational programs aimed at increasing staff awareness and knowledge of security risks, ensuring they can recognize \n\nand respond to threats effectively.\n\nThese grouped measures provide a comprehensive approach to managing risks, addressing both technical and human factors, and \n\nensuring that security is integrated across all aspects of the organization.\n\nHigh risks must be mitigated through the development or selection of appropriate security controls.\n\nExamples of mitigation controls include:\n\nImplementing firewalls and encryption for data protection.\n\nEstablishing formal procedures and protocols for incident response.\n\nSecuring physical access to sensitive equipment.\n\n3.6.2 Transfer\n\nTransferring the risk to a third party by purchasing insurance, outsourcing risk-prone activities, or signing contracts with vendors. This \n\napproach shifts some or all of the financial burden or operational responsibility to another entity.\n\nRisks may be transferred through methods such as insurance policies, contracts with suppliers, or outsourcing to specialized service \n\nproviders.\n\nExamples of risk transfer include:\n\nPurchasing cybersecurity insurance to cover potential breaches.\n\nContracting with a third-party vendor for data storage with explicit security requirements.\n\nOutsourcing payroll or HR services to an external provider.\n\n\n\n3.6.3 Avoid\n\nEliminating the risk entirely by discontinuing the business activity or process that leads to the risk. This option is suitable when the risk \n\npresents an unacceptably high likelihood of occurrence or impact.\n\nAvoiding risks involves ceasing activities that introduce the identified risk.\n\nExamples of risk avoidance include:\n\nDiscontinuing the use of legacy systems that cannot be secured effectively.\n\nCancelling projects or products that introduce significant security vulnerabilities.\n\nAvoiding the use of certain high-risk technologies or suppliers.\n\n3.6.4 Accept\n\nAccepting the risk if the cost of mitigating or transferring it outweighs the potential impact. This approach is typically used for low-level risks \n\nor where the cost of controls is prohibitively high.\n\nAcceptance of a risk is only permissible after a thorough analysis that demonstrates the cost of implementing controls is higher than the \n\npotential impact of the risk.\n\nExamples of risk acceptance include:\n\nContinuing to operate with known low-impact vulnerabilities due to the high cost of remediation.\n\nMaintaining legacy equipment with a known, manageable risk until a scheduled upgrade.\n\n3.7 Risk Remediation and Treatment Process\n\n1. Risk Identification and Prioritization \n\nFollowing the risk assessment process, all identified risks are categorized based on their severity. Risks are classified as low, medium, \n\nor high based on the calculated risk level (multiplying the impact and likelihood scores).\n\n2. Objective Setting for Risk Treatment \n\nThe company establishes specific objectives for mitigating or treating the risks, particularly focusing on high risks. While the treatment \n\nof medium and low risks is optional, company managers may choose to address them for continuous improvement of risk management \n\npractices.\n\n3. Risk Treatment Options \n\nThe company uses a mix of controls, risk transfer, avoidance, and acceptance to manage risks effectively based on their criticality. \n\nDepending on the nature of the risk and available resources, one of the treatment options will be selected based on risk criticality:\n\nLow: Risks can be accepted.\n\nMedium: Risks are to be avoided or mitigated by measures as far as economically and technically feasible. Can be accepted if not \n\nfeasible.\n\nHigh: Risks should be mitigated.\n\n4. Impact and Likelihood Reassessment \n\nAfter selecting a risk treatment option, the risk owner must reassess the impact and likelihood values based on the planned controls. \n\nThis reassessment helps determine the residual risk after implementing the treatment.\n\n5. Implementation and Monitoring \n\nOnce the treatment option is selected and the new risk levels are determined, the implementation phase begins. The company ensures \n\nthat the chosen controls or treatments are applied effectively, and the risk is monitored to ensure that it remains within acceptable limits.\n\n6. Documentation and Reporting \n\nThe results of the risk treatment process, including the chosen options, reassessed risk levels, and implementation status, must be \n\ndocumented and reported in the company's Risk Treatment Report. This report is reviewed periodically to ensure all treatments are \n\neffective and up to date.\n\n\n\nThis process provides a structured approach to mitigate and manage risks in alignment with the company's risk appetite and strategic \n\nobjectives.\n\n3.8 Risk Appetite and Regular Reviews\n\nThe company defines a moderate risk tolerance, meaning it is willing to accept some residual risk after implementing necessary controls.\n\nRisk Tolerance: Residual risks after controls must align with the company's moderate risk appetite.\n\nAnnual Review: Risk assessments must be updated annually or when new risks are identified. All updates are documented in the Risk \n\nAssessment Report.\n\nRegular reviews ensure that the company's risk management efforts remain current and aligned with its risk tolerance.\n\n3.9 Regular Reviews of Risk Assessment and Risk Treatment\n\nThe company ensures that its Risk Assessment Report is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect the latest identified risks and risk \n\ntreatment measures. These reviews are essential for maintaining an up-to-date understanding of risks and their potential impact.\n\nAnnual Review Requirement: A thorough review and update of the Risk Assessment Report must be performed at least once per \n\nyear to ensure continuous identification and management of risks.\n\nUpdate Upon New Risk Discovery: The Risk Assessment Report must be updated immediately whenever new risks are identified, \n\nensuring that the company remains proactive in its risk management.\n\nValidation of Risk Treatment: All risk treatments in place must be assessed annually to validate their effectiveness and make \n\nnecessary adjustments to mitigate any emerging risks or vulnerabilities.\n\nRegular reviews of the Risk Assessment Report ensure that risks are continuously monitored, and appropriate treatment measures are in \n\nplace and effective. The report must be updated annually or as new risks emerge.\n\n3.10 Reporting\n\nThe company requires that all risk assessment activities are documented thoroughly and consistently. This ensures transparency and allows \n\nthe company to track its risk management efforts over time.\n\nDocumentation of Risk Assessments: The results of all risk assessments and subsequent reviews must be recorded in the Risk \n\nAssessment Report to provide a clear record of identified risks and their treatments.\n\nMaintenance of Risk Reports: All versions of the Risk Assessment Report must be maintained securely to ensure that risk treatment \n\nprogress and updates are traceable and available for audit purposes.\n\nTransparency and Accountability: The Risk Assessment Report must reflect the company's ongoing efforts to manage and mitigate \n\nrisks, providing insight into the company's risk profile over time.\n\nAll risk assessment findings and updates must be documented in the Risk Assessment Report, ensuring a clear, traceable record for \n\ncompliance, audit, and ongoing risk management purposes.\n\n3.11 Threat Assessment Plan\n\nThe company's Threat Assessment Plan is designed to collect, analyze, and manage information related to existing or potential threats. \n\nThis plan ensures that proactive measures are in place to prevent harm to the organization. Threat assessment activities are integrated into \n\nthe company's risk management process, providing essential inputs for implementing safeguards.\n\n3.11.1 Components of the Threat Assessment Plan\n\nThe Threat Assessment Plan includes several key components that ensure a structured and proactive approach to identifying, managing, \n\nand mitigating potential threats to the company. These components integrate with the company's broader risk management and security \n\nframeworks to maintain business resiliency.\n\n\n\nBusiness Resiliency Threat Assessment Documentation: The company maintains comprehensive threat assessment documentation \n\nto systematically identify and evaluate potential threats. This documentation serves as a reference point for business continuity and \n\nresiliency efforts, ensuring that all recognized threats are reviewed, cataloged, and prioritized for further action.\n\nRisk Registry: A Risk Registry is maintained as part of the company's Business Resiliency Program. It plays a pivotal role in tracking \n\nand managing all identified risks. The registry offers a structured method for ongoing monitoring and ensures that risks are regularly \n\nassessed and mitigated in alignment with business priorities.\n\nSecurity Incident Management: The company enforces established policies, procedures, and plans for the handling of security \n\nincidents. Annual incident response exercises and training are conducted to ensure the workforce is adequately prepared to respond \n\nto security events. This preparedness helps improve the effectiveness of response measures and enhances the overall security posture.\n\nPeriodic Review of Access Rights: Periodic reviews of both logical and physical access rights are performed to verify that only \n\nauthorized personnel have access to critical systems and data. These reviews are essential to maintaining security standards and \n\nreducing the likelihood of unauthorized access. Reviews are conducted in accordance with the company's Access Control Policies and \n\nare a key part of its overall security framework.\n\nGovernance Activities: Regular governance activities, including meetings with executive management, ensure that the threat \n\nassessment process remains aligned with the company's organizational goals. These meetings provide oversight of the threat \n\nassessment activities and reinforce the company's commitment to continuous improvement in threat detection, analysis, and mitigation.\n\nThe Components of the Threat Assessment Plan provide a comprehensive approach to identifying, evaluating, and managing threats. \n\nThrough well-documented assessments, continuous risk tracking, incident management exercises, and governance oversight, the company \n\nmaintains a strong and proactive threat management process. This ensures resilience against potential threats and supports the overall risk \n\nmanagement framework.\n\n3.11.2 Threat Assessment Plan Implementation\n\nThe Threat Assessment Plan is a critical component of the company's overall risk management framework. It ensures that threat \n\nassessment activities are continuously integrated and aligned with the company's security goals, enabling proactive identification, \n\nevaluation, and communication of potential threats that may affect the company's operations, assets, and reputation.\n\nIntegration into Risk Management Framework: The threat assessment plan is embedded within the broader Risk Management \n\nFramework to ensure that threat intelligence and assessment activities are conducted in parallel with risk assessments. This alignment \n\nensures that both internal and external threats are considered in the decision-making process for risk treatment and security strategies.\n\nIdentification of Emerging Threats: The plan involves the systematic identification of new and emerging threats. This includes \n\nanalyzing threat data from a variety of sources, including security incident reports, threat intelligence feeds, and industry reports. The \n\ncompany actively monitors for any changes in the threat landscape that could impact its systems, operations, or personnel.\n\nEvaluation and Prioritization of Threats: Once threats are identified, they are evaluated for their potential impact on company assets \n\nand operations. The evaluation process includes assigning threat levels based on factors such as likelihood, potential damage, and the \n\ncompany's risk tolerance. High-priority threats are addressed through immediate risk treatment or mitigation measures, while lower-level \n\nthreats are continuously monitored.\n\nCommunication and Reporting: Clear communication channels are established to ensure that threat assessment findings are shared \n\nwith key stakeholders within the company. This includes regular reports to executive management, the security team, and risk \n\nowners. Threat reports are used to inform risk treatment decisions, update security controls, and make recommendations for additional \n\nsafeguards.\n\nContinuous Monitoring and Review: The Threat Assessment Plan is not static; it is reviewed and updated regularly to account for \n\nevolving threats and changing business conditions. The company performs periodic reviews to ensure that the threat assessment \n\nprocess remains effective and that any changes in the threat landscape are promptly addressed. Threat assessments are aligned with \n\nthe company's overall security and business continuity plans.\n\nCollaboration with External Entities: To enhance threat intelligence, the company may collaborate with external partners, industry \n\ngroups, and government agencies. This collaboration helps gather additional insights on potential threats and enables the company to \n\nstay ahead of adversarial tactics and techniques.\n\nThe Threat Assessment Plan is a dynamic and integral part of the company's security strategy, seamlessly integrated with the broader risk \n\nmanagement framework. By continuously identifying, evaluating, and communicating emerging threats, the company ensures proactive \n\n\n\nresponses to potential risks, thereby strengthening its overall security posture and resilience.\n\n4 Document Administration\n\n4.1 Ownership and Review\n\n \n\n4.2 Monitoring and Enforcement\n\n4.3 Related Documents\n\n4.3.1 Internal documents\n\nInformation Security Policy \n\nInformation Security Organization Policy\n\n4.4 Approvals\n\n4.5 Revision History\n\nFollow the link for details of revisions. \n\nThe Document Owner owns this Document and is responsible for reviewing the Document for updates annually, or following any major \n\nchanges to Squirro AG's compliance environment.

All \n\naccess is regulated using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), adhering to the Principle of Least Privilege to ensure that each user has \n\nonly the necessary access required to perform their duties.\n\nMinimum Necessary Access: User access to systems is determined by job classification, ensuring that only the minimum necessary \n\nlevel of access is granted.\n\nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC): The assignment of user rights and access to systems is regulated by the RBAC method, \n\nensuring that access levels align with user roles and responsibilities.\n\nSegregation of Duties: The need for segregation of duties is considered when assigning user rights, preventing potential conflicts of \n\ninterest or undue concentration of authority.\n\nFormal Documentation and Authorization: All access requests, including the addition, deletion, and modification of user IDs, \n\nauthentication factors, and other identifying objects, must be documented and formally authorized.\n\nAccess Request Process: Workforce members initiate access requests by creating an issue in the company's ticketing system, \n\ndetailing the type of access needed.\n\nIdentity Verification: User identities must be verified in person whenever possible before granting access to new accounts. For remote \n\nemployees, verification may be conducted over the phone, with the method of verification recorded in the ticketing system.\n\nAuthorization by Security Officer: The Security Officer is responsible for granting or rejecting access based on the employee's role \n\nand job classification. If additional access is required, the requester must provide a valid reason as part of the request.\n\nReview and Documentation: If an access request is rejected, it must go through a further review process, with detailed documentation. \n\nApproved requests are marked as complete and include all pertinent notes.\n\nAccess to the company's systems is carefully regulated through RBAC, ensuring that users are granted only the minimum necessary access \n\nfor their roles. Formal documentation and identity verification are required, with reviews conducted for additional access requests to \n\nmaintain security and accountability.\n\n3.2 Access Reviews\n\nUser access to company systems and services will be subject to periodic reviews to ensure that accounts, including third-party or vendor \n\naccounts, are appropriately assigned based on job functions. These reviews help maintain compliance with the Principle of Least Privilege \n\nand ensure access rights are adjusted as needed.\n\nQuarterly Access Reviews: Management will conduct formal access reviews at least once every quarter to verify that the roles and \n\npermissions associated with all user accounts, including third-party or vendor accounts, are still appropriate.\n\nJob Function Alignment: Access reviews focus on ensuring that user roles and permissions are aligned with current job functions and \n\nthat no excess or unauthorized access exists.\n\nManagement Authorization: During the access review, management is responsible for confirming that user accounts are in compliance \n\nwith established authorization requirements.\n\nQuarterly access reviews ensure that user accounts, including third-party and vendor accounts, remain aligned with job responsibilities, \n\npreventing unnecessary or unauthorized access to sensitive systems. These reviews are a key part of the company's efforts to maintain \n\nappropriate security controls.\n\n3.3 User Identification and Authentication\n\nTo ensure the security of system components, users and administrators must be authenticated using at least one authentication factor. This \n\nprocess is critical to safeguarding the company's systems and sensitive information.\n\nAuthentication Factors: Access will require at least one of the following:\n\nSomething you know, such as a password or passphrase.\n\n\n\nSomething you have, such as a token device or smart card.\n\nSomething you are, such as a biometric element.\n\nUnique Login Credentials: Each user will have a unique login ID and password, ensuring individual accountability.\n\nAuthentication Requirements: Single sign-on (SSO) and minimum password requirements will be enforced based on the company's \n\nPassword Policy. Passwords will never be displayed, transmitted, or stored in plain text.\n\nDefault Accounts: Default accounts on all production systems, including root, will be deleted, disabled, or restricted to a limited number \n\nof authorized administrators. These accounts will only be used under exceptional circumstances with documented business justification \n\nand management approval.\n\nShared Accounts: The use of group, shared, or generic accounts is prohibited unless absolutely necessary and approved by \n\nmanagement. Individual user identity must be confirmed before access is granted, and all actions must be traceable to a specific user.\n\nAuthentication Tokens: Physical or logical tokens, smart cards, or certificates will be assigned to individual users and cannot be \n\nshared. Additional controls, such as PINs or biometric data, will ensure only authorized users can access accounts.\n\nAutomated Log-on: Automated log-on configurations, other than the company's approved password management tools, are prohibited \n\nfrom storing user passwords or bypassing password entry on workstations or production systems.\n\nThe company enforces strict identification and authentication policies, requiring the use of unique credentials, secure authentication factors, \n\nand limiting access to default and shared accounts. These measures ensure accountability and safeguard access to critical systems.\n\n3.4 Multi-factor Authentication\n\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all system access where technically feasible, providing an additional layer of security for \n\nusers, administrators, and third parties.\n\nUse of MFA: MFA will be enforced to enhance security by requiring multiple types of authentication for access to systems.\n\nSystem Configuration: Systems using MFA must:\n\nPrevent replay attacks through secure token generation and validation processes.\n\nRequire at least two distinct types of authentication factors (e.g., something you know, something you have, or something you are).\n\nRestrict any bypassing of MFA by users, including administrative users, unless specifically documented and approved by \n\nmanagement on an exception basis, for a limited time period.\n\nRemote Access: MFA is mandatory for all remote access to the company's network, including access by users, administrators, and \n\nthird-party vendors. This ensures that remote connections are secure and access is only granted to authenticated users.\n\nMulti-factor authentication is essential to securing system access, particularly for remote access scenarios. By requiring multiple \n\nauthentication factors and preventing unauthorized bypassing, the company maintains a high level of security for all users and systems.\n\n3.5 Automated Logoffs\n\nAutomated logoffs are implemented to secure devices and systems by minimizing unauthorized access due to inactivity.\n\nScreen Lock Timeout: Company-issued devices and any bring-your-own or third-party devices connected to company systems will \n\nenforce a screensaver lock with a timeout of 15 minutes or less of inactivity. This ensures that devices are locked when not actively in \n\nuse, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\n\nSystem Logoff: Where technically feasible, the company's applications and systems will automatically log users out after 15 minutes of \n\ninactivity or upon closure of the system or internet browser. This configuration secures the system by terminating sessions that may \n\notherwise remain vulnerable to unauthorized access.\n\nAutomated logoffs are an important control for ensuring security, by locking or logging out inactive sessions on both devices and systems. \n\nThese measures protect sensitive data by ensuring that unattended devices and open sessions are quickly secured.\n\n\n\n3.6 Third-Party Access\n\nThird-party access to the company's systems is strictly controlled to ensure security and accountability when external entities access critical \n\nsystem components.\n\nTime-Limited Access: Accounts provided to third parties for system access, support, or maintenance will be enabled only for the \n\nrequired time period. Access will be granted based on documented approval from management and will be promptly disabled once the \n\nspecific task is completed.\n\nMonitoring of Remote Access: All third-party remote access will be continuously monitored by company personnel for any signs of \n\nunauthorized or unexpected activity. Monitoring will include real-time oversight and logging of access events to ensure accountability and \n\ndetect potential security risks.\n\nAuthorization and Documentation: All third-party access must be authorized by management, with clear documentation outlining the \n\npurpose, duration, and scope of access. No third-party access will be granted without proper authorization.\n\nThird-party access is restricted and closely monitored to ensure that external entities are granted system access only when necessary, with \n\nappropriate safeguards in place to detect and address any unauthorized activity.\n\n3.7 Application and System Accounts\n\nApplication and system accounts will be managed to ensure access is limited to only what is necessary for system operability and will follow \n\nstrict guidelines for security.\n\nProvisioning of Accounts: All application and system accounts will be provisioned based on documented authorization from \n\nmanagement. Access privileges will be limited to only what is necessary for the application or system to function effectively, \n\nminimizing unnecessary access.\n\nInteractive Login Management: \n\nPrevention of Interactive Use: Interactive login through system or application accounts will be prevented unless specifically \n\nrequired for an exceptional circumstance. \n\nTime-Limited Access: If interactive access is required, it will be restricted to the necessary timeframe to complete the required \n\ntask. \n\nBusiness Justification: A documented business justification must accompany any request for interactive login, explaining why \n\nsuch access is necessary.\n\nManagement Approval: Interactive use must be explicitly approved by management, ensuring that only authorized personnel can \n\nuse the account.\n\nAccountability: Every action taken using an interactive account must be attributable to an individual user. Individual user identity \n\nwill be confirmed before access is granted.\n\nApplication and system accounts will be tightly controlled to ensure that they are only used for necessary system operations, with interactive \n\naccess limited to exceptional circumstances and approved by management. Every action must be linked to an identifiable user to maintain \n\naccountability.\n\n3.8 Use of Utility Programs\n\nAccess to utility programs that have the potential to bypass normal operating system or application controls will be restricted to authorized \n\npersonnel to maintain the security and integrity of the company's systems.\n\nRestricted Access to Utility Programs: Only authorized system administrators will have access to manage utility programs such as \n\nanti-virus consoles, diagnostic tools, patching software, backup utilities, and network tools. These programs will be restricted from \n\ngeneral user access due to their ability to bypass normal security controls.\n\nPrivileged Utility Access Control: \n\nStandard User Restrictions: Standard users will be restricted from accessing privileged utilities or making modifications to their \n\nconfigurations.\n\n\n\nAuthentication and Access Controls: Strict authentication mechanisms and access controls will be implemented to ensure only \n\nauthorized administrators can access or modify utility programs, preventing unauthorized changes to the system.\n\nUtility programs with the ability to bypass security controls will be strictly restricted to authorized system administrators, with standard users \n\ndenied access. This ensures the integrity of system configurations and limits unauthorized access to privileged tools.\n\n3.9 Employee Termination/Offboarding Procedures\n\nThe company will revoke system and physical access for terminated users (employees, third parties, vendors, and other personnel) \n\npromptly to safeguard its systems and data.\n\nAccess Revocation: System and physical access will be revoked within one business day of the termination date. This applies to all \n\nterminated users including employees, vendors, and third parties.\n\nTermination Checklist and Notification:\n\nThe HR/People department, along with the users and their supervisors, are responsible for notifying system administrators of \n\nupcoming separations and ensuring the completion of a \"Termination Checklist.\"\n\nSystem administrators will terminate access rights within the established service level agreements (SLAs) upon notification of \n\ntermination or separation.\n\nAsset Return Tracking: \n\nThe HR/People department (or designated department) will track the return of all electronic and physical assets, including \n\nlaptops, files, access mechanisms (such as keys, access cards, badges, and multi-factor authentication tokens) as part of the \n\noffboarding process.\n\nIncident-Based Access Termination:\n\nSystem administrators will terminate a user's access if there is evidence or suspicion that:\n\nThe user has been misusing their access rights.\n\nA user's password has been compromised. If the user is not responsible for the password compromise, a new password may \n\nbe provided.\n\nUpon termination, the company ensures that access to systems and physical locations is revoked within one business day, while the \n\nHR/People department oversees asset returns and the completion of termination procedures. Access is also terminated if there is misuse or \n\nevidence of a password compromise.\n\n3.10 Disabling Accounts: High-Risk Users\n\nThe company will disable accounts of users deemed to pose a high risk to its systems and data. Accounts will be disabled for a specified \n\nperiod depending on the risk severity.\n\nUser intends to sell company information to a competitor Immediately                 1 month                     \n\nUser accesses unauthorized sensitive data without a business \n\nneed \n\nImmediately                 3 weeks                     \n\nUser deliberately attempts to bypass security controls Immediately                 6 weeks                     \n\nUser leaks confidential information to external parties Immediately                 2 months                    \n\nUser violates policy by sharing credentials Immediately                 2 weeks                     \n\nUser installs unauthorized software or malware Immediately                 1 month                     \n\nUser repeatedly fails to comply with security procedures Immediately                 4 weeks                     \n\nUser uses company resources for illegal activities Immediately                 Permanent Disablement       \n\nRiskTime Period to DisableDuration of Disablement\n\n\n\nHigh-risk accounts will be disabled promptly based on the nature of the risk and the severity of the violation. The duration of disablement is \n\ndetermined by the risk posed to the company's systems and data integrity.\n\n4 Document Administration\n\n4.1 Ownership and Review\n\n  \n\n4.2 Monitoring and Enforcement\n\n4.3 Related Documents\n\n4.3.1 Internal documents\n\nInformation Security Policy \n\nInformation Security Organization Policy\n\n4.4 Approvals\n\n4.5 Revision History\n\nFollow the link for details of revisions. \n\nThe Document Owner owns this Document and is responsible for reviewing the Document for updates annually, or following any major \n\nchanges to Squrrio AG's compliance environment.

sensitive data based on a risk-\n\nbased approach and implemented where feasible. \n\nAccess Restriction: Physical access to the company's secure facilities, such as server rooms and critical infrastructure, is restricted to \n\nauthorized personnel only. In remote locations, employees are responsible for securing access to company resources through digital \n\nmeans, such as VPNs and secure login systems.\n\nEmployee Identification: In secure controlled facilities, employees are required to wear identification badges to distinguish themselves \n\nas authorized personnel. In remote environments, this control may not be applicable but should be supplemented by other identity \n\nverification methods where necessary.\n\nVisitor Management: Visitors and vendors must be escorted by an authorized employee at all times while on company premises. Visitor \n\naccess may not be applicable in remote locations, but employees are required to ensure the confidentiality and security of any sensitive \n\ninformation.\n\nIncident Reporting: All workforce members are responsible for reporting unauthorized visitors or access attempts to company facilities \n\nor systems. This includes both physical locations and remote work environments. Reporting should be immediate to the Security Officer \n\nor Facility Manager.\n\nRecord-Keeping: It is recommended to retain a detailed record of each physical access, including visits, maintenance, and repairs \n\nwhere feasible.\n\nGiven the remote nature of many locations, physical controls will be implemented flexibly based on an assessment of the risks involved in \n\neach environment.\n\n3.2 Access Requirements\n\nPhysical access to secure facilities is managed through badge readers, smart locks, and physical keys. In environments where these \n\ncontrols are not applicable, such as coworking spaces, alternative security measures based on risk assessments will be applied.\n\nBadge and Key Management: Access to the company's badge and key systems is restricted to authorized personnel based on a need-\n\nto-know basis. Workforce members must report lost or stolen keys or badges immediately to their manager, and the Facility Manager \n\nmust re-provision access or change locks within 7 days.\n\nRestricted Areas: Secure areas, such as server rooms, must be locked when unattended, and access is granted only to authorized \n\nemployees. In remote or coworking environments, employees must ensure their devices and sensitive information are secured.\n\nVisitor Controls: Visitors must sign a log upon entering secure facilities, indicating the date, time, purpose, and point of contact. Visitor \n\nlogs must be kept for at least 3 months. In remote environments, visitor controls may not be applicable but should be replaced by strong \n\ndigital access controls.\n\nLoading and Delivery Areas: Access to loading and delivery areas is restricted to authorized personnel, and shipments should be \n\ninspected according to Asset Management procedures. In remote locations, this control may not be necessary but should be considered \n\nif the location handles sensitive assets.\n\n3.3 Maintenance and Monitoring\n\nContinuous monitoring and maintenance of physical security systems are crucial for protecting the company's assets. These requirements \n\napply primarily to formal company locations, while remote work environments may not require such stringent controls.\n\nMany of the company's operations take place either in its own offices or remotely, including at home, in cafes, or coworking spaces. \n\nThe company's own offices may also be considered as remote locations in certain contexts.\n\nAs a result, certain physical security controls, such as badge systems or visitor logs, may not be applicable to all environments. \n\nSecurity measures will be applied based on a risk-based approach and implemented where feasible. The specific controls \n\nimplemented will vary depending on the location and the nature of the activities being conducted there.\n\n\n\nMaintenance of Security Equipment: Any repairs or maintenance to physical security equipment, including locks, cameras, and access \n\ncontrol systems, must be documented, with records retained for at least seven years.\n\nCCTV Monitoring: Secure areas must be monitored by CCTV, with recordings stored for at least 3 months. For remote locations, \n\nemployees are responsible for ensuring security through digital means, such as monitoring login activity and using endpoint security \n\nmeasures.\n\nAlarm Systems: Alarm systems must be installed in critical areas and tested regularly. In remote work environments, employees should \n\nensure the security of their workspace, devices, and data through encryption and secure access controls.\n\n3.4 Workstation Security\n\nWorkstation security is essential to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive company data. In formal facilities, workstations are protected \n\nby physical and technical safeguards, while in remote locations, employees must follow strict digital security measures.\n\nAccess to Workstations: Only authorized employees may access company-owned workstations, and these devices must be used \n\nsolely for business purposes. Workstations must be locked or logged off when left unattended.\n\nPhysical Safeguards: In shared or open workspaces, workstations must be positioned to prevent unauthorized viewing of sensitive \n\ninformation. Employees should use privacy filters or position screens away from public view.\n\nPortable Device Security: Laptops and other portable devices containing sensitive information must be secured when left unattended, \n\nusing cable locks or locked storage. Employees in remote environments must also adhere to the company's Encryption Policy.\n\n3.5 Visitor and Vendor Management\n\nVisitor and vendor access to company facilities must be tightly controlled, though these measures may not be applicable in remote work \n\nenvironments.\n\nEscort Requirement: Visitors and vendors must be escorted by an authorized company employee while on the premises. Remote \n\nenvironments, such as cafes, may not have the need for physical escorts, but sensitive data must be protected.\n\nVisitor Badges: Visitors in formal company locations must wear badges that distinguish them from employees. These badges must be \n\nreturned when leaving the facility.\n\nVisitor Logs: Logs documenting visitor access, including date, time, and purpose, must be maintained for at least 3 months. In remote \n\nenvironments, visitor logs may not apply, but employees must ensure secure access to any shared devices or data.\n\n3.6 Data Center and Building Standards\n\nThe company does not maintain its own data centers and instead relies on cloud infrastructure providers such as AWS and Azure. However, \n\nany physical infrastructure under the company's control must adhere to high security standards.\n\nSecurity Perimeters: Secure perimeters must be established around areas containing critical data or infrastructure. Entry points should \n\nbe protected with access controls and monitored by surveillance cameras.\n\nCCTV Monitoring: Critical areas must be monitored by CCTV, and recordings must be kept for at least 3 months.\n\nBackup Power: Backup power supplies, such as UPS systems, must be available for critical infrastructure to ensure continuous \n\noperations during power outages.\n\nEmergency Power Shut-off: Emergency power shut-off switches must be located near exits in critical equipment rooms to allow for \n\nrapid shutdown during emergencies.\n\n3.7 Enforcement of Facility Access Policies\n\nTo ensure compliance with security policies, violations of these controls will result in investigation and potential disciplinary actions.\n\nIncident Reporting: Employees, visitors, and vendors must report any violations of physical security policies to their manager or the \n\nSecurity Officer immediately.\n\n\n\nDisciplinary Actions: Employees found violating these policies may face disciplinary actions, up to and including termination. Visitors \n\nand vendors may have their access privileges revoked.\n\nIn remote environments, security measures may be adapted based on risk assessments, but all employees are responsible for safeguarding \n\ncompany data and resources. Non-compliance will be investigated and addressed accordingly.\n\n4 Document Administration\n\n4.1 Ownership and Review\n\n  \n\n4.2 Monitoring and Enforcement\n\n4.3 Related Documents\n\n4.3.1 Internal documents\n\nInformation Security Policy \n\nInformation Security Organization Policy\n\n4.4 Approvals\n\n4.5 Revision History\n\nFollow the link for details of revisions. \n\nThe Document Owner owns this Document and is responsible for reviewing the Document for updates annually, or following any major \n\nchanges to Squirro AG's compliance environment.

All \n\naccess is regulated using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), adhering to the Principle of Least Privilege to ensure that each user has \n\nonly the necessary access required to perform their duties.\n\nMinimum Necessary Access: User access to systems is determined by job classification, ensuring that only the minimum necessary \n\nlevel of access is granted.\n\nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC): The assignment of user rights and access to systems is regulated by the RBAC method, \n\nensuring that access levels align with user roles and responsibilities.\n\nSegregation of Duties: The need for segregation of duties is considered when assigning user rights, preventing potential conflicts of \n\ninterest or undue concentration of authority.\n\nFormal Documentation and Authorization: All access requests, including the addition, deletion, and modification of user IDs, \n\nauthentication factors, and other identifying objects, must be documented and formally authorized.\n\nAccess Request Process: Workforce members initiate access requests by creating an issue in the company's ticketing system, \n\ndetailing the type of access needed.\n\nIdentity Verification: User identities must be verified in person whenever possible before granting access to new accounts. For remote \n\nemployees, verification may be conducted over the phone, with the method of verification recorded in the ticketing system.\n\nAuthorization by Security Officer: The Security Officer is responsible for granting or rejecting access based on the employee's role \n\nand job classification. If additional access is required, the requester must provide a valid reason as part of the request.\n\nReview and Documentation: If an access request is rejected, it must go through a further review process, with detailed documentation. \n\nApproved requests are marked as complete and include all pertinent notes.\n\nAccess to the company's systems is carefully regulated through RBAC, ensuring that users are granted only the minimum necessary access \n\nfor their roles. Formal documentation and identity verification are required, with reviews conducted for additional access requests to \n\nmaintain security and accountability.\n\n3.2 Access Reviews\n\nUser access to company systems and services will be subject to periodic reviews to ensure that accounts, including third-party or vendor \n\naccounts, are appropriately assigned based on job functions. These reviews help maintain compliance with the Principle of Least Privilege \n\nand ensure access rights are adjusted as needed.\n\nQuarterly Access Reviews: Management will conduct formal access reviews at least once every quarter to verify that the roles and \n\npermissions associated with all user accounts, including third-party or vendor accounts, are still appropriate.\n\nJob Function Alignment: Access reviews focus on ensuring that user roles and permissions are aligned with current job functions and \n\nthat no excess or unauthorized access exists.\n\nManagement Authorization: During the access review, management is responsible for confirming that user accounts are in compliance \n\nwith established authorization requirements.\n\nQuarterly access reviews ensure that user accounts, including third-party and vendor accounts, remain aligned with job responsibilities, \n\npreventing unnecessary or unauthorized access to sensitive systems. These reviews are a key part of the company's efforts to maintain \n\nappropriate security controls.\n\n3.3 User Identification and Authentication\n\nTo ensure the security of system components, users and administrators must be authenticated using at least one authentication factor. This \n\nprocess is critical to safeguarding the company's systems and sensitive information.\n\nAuthentication Factors: Access will require at least one of the following:\n\nSomething you know, such as a password or passphrase.\n\n\n\nSomething you have, such as a token device or smart card.\n\nSomething you are, such as a biometric element.\n\nUnique Login Credentials: Each user will have a unique login ID and password, ensuring individual accountability.\n\nAuthentication Requirements: Single sign-on (SSO) and minimum password requirements will be enforced based on the company's \n\nPassword Policy. Passwords will never be displayed, transmitted, or stored in plain text.\n\nDefault Accounts: Default accounts on all production systems, including root, will be deleted, disabled, or restricted to a limited number \n\nof authorized administrators. These accounts will only be used under exceptional circumstances with documented business justification \n\nand management approval.\n\nShared Accounts: The use of group, shared, or generic accounts is prohibited unless absolutely necessary and approved by \n\nmanagement. Individual user identity must be confirmed before access is granted, and all actions must be traceable to a specific user.\n\nAuthentication Tokens: Physical or logical tokens, smart cards, or certificates will be assigned to individual users and cannot be \n\nshared. Additional controls, such as PINs or biometric data, will ensure only authorized users can access accounts.\n\nAutomated Log-on: Automated log-on configurations, other than the company's approved password management tools, are prohibited \n\nfrom storing user passwords or bypassing password entry on workstations or production systems.\n\nThe company enforces strict identification and authentication policies, requiring the use of unique credentials, secure authentication factors, \n\nand limiting access to default and shared accounts. These measures ensure accountability and safeguard access to critical systems.\n\n3.4 Multi-factor Authentication\n\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all system access where technically feasible, providing an additional layer of security for \n\nusers, administrators, and third parties.\n\nUse of MFA: MFA will be enforced to enhance security by requiring multiple types of authentication for access to systems.\n\nSystem Configuration: Systems using MFA must:\n\nPrevent replay attacks through secure token generation and validation processes.\n\nRequire at least two distinct types of authentication factors (e.g., something you know, something you have, or something you are).\n\nRestrict any bypassing of MFA by users, including administrative users, unless specifically documented and approved by \n\nmanagement on an exception basis, for a limited time period.\n\nRemote Access: MFA is mandatory for all remote access to the company's network, including access by users, administrators, and \n\nthird-party vendors. This ensures that remote connections are secure and access is only granted to authenticated users.\n\nMulti-factor authentication is essential to securing system access, particularly for remote access scenarios. By requiring multiple \n\nauthentication factors and preventing unauthorized bypassing, the company maintains a high level of security for all users and systems.\n\n3.5 Automated Logoffs\n\nAutomated logoffs are implemented to secure devices and systems by minimizing unauthorized access due to inactivity.\n\nScreen Lock Timeout: Company-issued devices and any bring-your-own or third-party devices connected to company systems will \n\nenforce a screensaver lock with a timeout of 15 minutes or less of inactivity. This ensures that devices are locked when not actively in \n\nuse, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\n\nSystem Logoff: Where technically feasible, the company's applications and systems will automatically log users out after 15 minutes of \n\ninactivity or upon closure of the system or internet browser. This configuration secures the system by terminating sessions that may \n\notherwise remain vulnerable to unauthorized access.\n\nAutomated logoffs are an important control for ensuring security, by locking or logging out inactive sessions on both devices and systems. \n\nThese measures protect sensitive data by ensuring that unattended devices and open sessions are quickly secured.\n\n\n\n3.6 Third-Party Access\n\nThird-party access to the company's systems is strictly controlled to ensure security and accountability when external entities access critical \n\nsystem components.\n\nTime-Limited Access: Accounts provided to third parties for system access, support, or maintenance will be enabled only for the \n\nrequired time period. Access will be granted based on documented approval from management and will be promptly disabled once the \n\nspecific task is completed.\n\nMonitoring of Remote Access: All third-party remote access will be continuously monitored by company personnel for any signs of \n\nunauthorized or unexpected activity. Monitoring will include real-time oversight and logging of access events to ensure accountability and \n\ndetect potential security risks.\n\nAuthorization and Documentation: All third-party access must be authorized by management, with clear documentation outlining the \n\npurpose, duration, and scope of access. No third-party access will be granted without proper authorization.\n\nThird-party access is restricted and closely monitored to ensure that external entities are granted system access only when necessary, with \n\nappropriate safeguards in place to detect and address any unauthorized activity.\n\n3.7 Application and System Accounts\n\nApplication and system accounts will be managed to ensure access is limited to only what is necessary for system operability and will follow \n\nstrict guidelines for security.\n\nProvisioning of Accounts: All application and system accounts will be provisioned based on documented authorization from \n\nmanagement. Access privileges will be limited to only what is necessary for the application or system to function effectively, \n\nminimizing unnecessary access.\n\nInteractive Login Management: \n\nPrevention of Interactive Use: Interactive login through system or application accounts will be prevented unless specifically \n\nrequired for an exceptional circumstance. \n\nTime-Limited Access: If interactive access is required, it will be restricted to the necessary timeframe to complete the required \n\ntask. \n\nBusiness Justification: A documented business justification must accompany any request for interactive login, explaining why \n\nsuch access is necessary.\n\nManagement Approval: Interactive use must be explicitly approved by management, ensuring that only authorized personnel can \n\nuse the account.\n\nAccountability: Every action taken using an interactive account must be attributable to an individual user. Individual user identity \n\nwill be confirmed before access is granted.\n\nApplication and system accounts will be tightly controlled to ensure that they are only used for necessary system operations, with interactive \n\naccess limited to exceptional circumstances and approved by management. Every action must be linked to an identifiable user to maintain \n\naccountability.\n\n3.8 Use of Utility Programs\n\nAccess to utility programs that have the potential to bypass normal operating system or application controls will be restricted to authorized \n\npersonnel to maintain the security and integrity of the company's systems.\n\nRestricted Access to Utility Programs: Only authorized system administrators will have access to manage utility programs such as \n\nanti-virus consoles, diagnostic tools, patching software, backup utilities, and network tools. These programs will be restricted from \n\ngeneral user access due to their ability to bypass normal security controls.\n\nPrivileged Utility Access Control: \n\nStandard User Restrictions: Standard users will be restricted from accessing privileged utilities or making modifications to their \n\nconfigurations.\n\n\n\nAuthentication and Access Controls: Strict authentication mechanisms and access controls will be implemented to ensure only \n\nauthorized administrators can access or modify utility programs, preventing unauthorized changes to the system.\n\nUtility programs with the ability to bypass security controls will be strictly restricted to authorized system administrators, with standard users \n\ndenied access. This ensures the integrity of system configurations and limits unauthorized access to privileged tools.\n\n3.9 Employee Termination/Offboarding Procedures\n\nThe company will revoke system and physical access for terminated users (employees, third parties, vendors, and other personnel) \n\npromptly to safeguard its systems and data.\n\nAccess Revocation: System and physical access will be revoked within one business day of the termination date. This applies to all \n\nterminated users including employees, vendors, and third parties.\n\nTermination Checklist and Notification:\n\nThe HR/People department, along with the users and their supervisors, are responsible for notifying system administrators of \n\nupcoming separations and ensuring the completion of a \"Termination Checklist.\"\n\nSystem administrators will terminate access rights within the established service level agreements (SLAs) upon notification of \n\ntermination or separation.\n\nAsset Return Tracking: \n\nThe HR/People department (or designated department) will track the return of all electronic and physical assets, including \n\nlaptops, files, access mechanisms (such as keys, access cards, badges, and multi-factor authentication tokens) as part of the \n\noffboarding process.\n\nIncident-Based Access Termination:\n\nSystem administrators will terminate a user's access if there is evidence or suspicion that:\n\nThe user has been misusing their access rights.\n\nA user's password has been compromised. If the user is not responsible for the password compromise, a new password may \n\nbe provided.\n\nUpon termination, the company ensures that access to systems and physical locations is revoked within one business day, while the \n\nHR/People department oversees asset returns and the completion of termination procedures. Access is also terminated if there is misuse or \n\nevidence of a password compromise.\n\n3.10 Disabling Accounts: High-Risk Users\n\nThe company will disable accounts of users deemed to pose a high risk to its systems and data. Accounts will be disabled for a specified \n\nperiod depending on the risk severity.\n\nUser intends to sell company information to a competitor Immediately                 1 month                     \n\nUser accesses unauthorized sensitive data without a business \n\nneed \n\nImmediately                 3 weeks                     \n\nUser deliberately attempts to bypass security controls Immediately                 6 weeks                     \n\nUser leaks confidential information to external parties Immediately                 2 months                    \n\nUser violates policy by sharing credentials Immediately                 2 weeks                     \n\nUser installs unauthorized software or malware Immediately                 1 month                     \n\nUser repeatedly fails to comply with security procedures Immediately                 4 weeks                     \n\nUser uses company resources for illegal activities Immediately                 Permanent Disablement       \n\nRiskTime Period to DisableDuration of Disablement\n\n\n\nHigh-risk accounts will be disabled promptly based on the nature of the risk and the severity of the violation.
