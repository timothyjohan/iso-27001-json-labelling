This data requires the highest level of protection due to its potential impact on the company \nand its customers if disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization.\nInternal Data: All data owned or licensed by the company. This data is intended for use within the organization and must be protected \nfrom unauthorized access, but it does not carry the same level of risk as Confidential/Restricted Data.\nPublic Information: Any information that is available within the public domain. This data has no existing local, national, or international \nlegal restrictions on access or usage and poses minimal risk to the company if disclosed or altered.\n\nThese definitions ensure a common understanding of data types and their respective sensitivity levels, which is crucial for implementing \nappropriate security measures and maintaining compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.\n3.1.2 Working Instructions\nThis working instruction is based on the guideline on the organization's assets and the classification scheme described therein.\nClassification Specification: The owner (editor) of the information should specify appropriate classification at the time of its creation.\nLabeling Responsibility: The author is responsible for the correct labeling of information.\nPeriodic Review: Where applicable, the owner should check periodically whether the information is still needed, and the classification is \nstill justified.\nAdoption of Existing Classifications: If an item of information has already been classified by another entity or a specific classification \nis required contractually, that classification must be adopted.\nPrinted Information Marking: Printed classified information shall be marked accordingly. The classification note \"internal use\" or \n\"confidential\" shall be placed on the title page and/or in the footer of the document.\nElectronic Information Tagging: Electronic information and data should be tagged with the available metadata.\nDevice Labeling: In order to keep the administrative effort within manageable limits, the devices carrying data are not labeled. \nEmployees are instructed to treat such devices and mobile devices as if they contained classified information.\nAccess Control: Access to information categorized as \"confidential\" is given on a \"need-to-know\" basis, i.e., an individual only receives \naccess to such information to the extent necessary for the performance of his or her work. Information categorized as \"internal use\" \nshould be available to employees by default.\nPrivileged Users: Classified information is only made available to privileged users. In the case of electronically stored information, \nappropriate authorizations must be assigned.\nSecurity of Devices: Devices carrying data and devices on which classified information is stored shall be kept securely locked or \npassword protected (e.g., employee laptops should not be locked, but should be password protected).\nData Deletion: If classified information on data carriers and devices is to be deleted, it should be done in line Asset Management Poli\ncy | 3.13 Disposal of Media and Devices and lead to the permanent destruction of such information.\nDefault Classification: Documents without a label should by default be treated as \"Internal Use\" unless they are marketing or sales \nmaterials or materials intended to be available publicly or for selected external parties (which should be verified with the document \nowner).\nThese generic requirements ensure that information is classified, labeled, reviewed, and protected appropriately, maintaining the security \nand integrity of the company's data throughout its lifecycle.\n3.2 Data Classification Scheme\nData classification, in the context of information security, is the classification of data based on its level of sensitivity and the impact to the \ncompany should that data be disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization. The classification of data helps determine what baseline \nsecurity controls are appropriate for safeguarding that data. All data should be classified into one of the following classifications:\n3.2.1 Confidential/Restricted Data\nData should be classified as Confidential/Restricted when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data could cause a \nserious or significant level of risk to the company or its customers. Examples of sensitive data include data protected by state or federal \nprivacy regulations (e.g., PHI & PII) and data protected by confidentiality agreements. The highest level of security controls should be \napplied to Confidential/Restricted Data:\nAccess Restrictions: Disclosure or access to Confidential/Restricted data is limited to specific use by individuals with a legitimate need-\nto-know. Explicit authorization by the CISO is required for access due to legal, contractual, privacy, or other constraints.\nProtection Measures: Must be protected to prevent loss, theft, unauthorized access, and/or unauthorized disclosure.\nData Destruction: Must be destroyed when no longer needed. Destruction must be in accordance with company policies and \nprocedures.\n\nIncident Response: Will require specific methodologies, procedures, and reporting requirements for the response and handling of \nincidents.\n3.2.2 Internal Use Data\nData should be classified as Internal Use when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data could result in a moderate \nlevel of risk to the company or its customers. This includes proprietary, ethical, or privacy considerations. Data must be protected from \nunauthorized access, modification, transmission, storage, or other use. This applies even though there may not be a civil statute requiring \nthis protection. Internal Use Data is restricted to personnel who have a legitimate reason to access it. By default, all data that is not explicitly \nclassified as Confidential/Restricted or Public data should be treated as Internal Use data. A reasonable level of security controls should be \napplied to Internal Use Data.\n3.2.3 Public Data\nData should be classified as Public when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data would result in little or no risk to \nthe company and its customers. It is further defined as information with no existing local, national, or international legal restrictions on \naccess or usage. While little or no controls are required to protect the confidentiality of Public data, some level of control is required to \nprevent unauthorized alteration or destruction of Public Data.\n3.2.4 De-identified Data\nThe company will de-identify data as a tool to remove personal information from data that it collects, uses, archives, and shares with other \norganizations. The de-identification process will allow the removal of direct identifiers, including all unique identifying numbers, \ncharacteristics, or codes. If a data set contains any amount or type of personal information, it will not be considered de-identified.\nThis data classification scheme ensures that all data handled by the company is appropriately classified based on its sensitivity and \npotential impact. By assigning one of the defined classifications, the company can implement suitable security controls to protect the data, \nthereby maintaining data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n3.3 Assessing Classification Level and Labeling\nThe goal of information security, as stated in the Information Security Policy, is to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of \nCorporate and Customer Data. Data classification reflects the level of impact to the company if confidentiality, integrity, or availability is \ncompromised.\n3.3.1 Classification Guidance\nIf a classification is not inherently obvious, consider each security objective using the following table as a guide. All data will be assigned one \nof the following four sensitivity levels:\n4 - \nRESTRICTE\nD (Critical)\nHighly \nsensitive \ninformation.\nDictated \nexternally by legal \nand/or contractual \nrequirements.\nMust be limited to \nonly authorized \nemployees, \ncontractors, and \nbusiness partners \nwith a specific \nbusiness need.\nSeriousImpact could \ninclude negatively \naffecting the \ncompany's \ncompetitive \nposition, violating \nregulatory \nrequirements, \ndamaging the \ncompany's \nPHI, sensitive PII, \nconfidential \nagreements\nClassificati\non\nDescriptionProtectionAccessDamageImpactExamples\n\nLegend:\nClassification: The level of sensitivity assigned to the data.\nDescription: An overview of the type of information and its sensitivity.\nProtection: The required level of protection based on legal, contractual, or internal policies.\nAccess: Who is allowed to access the data and under what conditions.\nDamage: The level of damage which would occur information were to become available to unauthorized parties.\nImpact: The potential consequences if the data were to be disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization.\nExamples: Typical examples of data that fall under each classification level.\n3.3.2 Labeling\nData must be labeled according to its classification to ensure proper handling. Labels should be clear and indicate the level of sensitivity. For \nexample:\nRestricted: \"CONFIDENTIAL/RESTRICTED\"\nConfidential: \"CONFIDENTIAL\"\nInternal Use: \"INTERNAL USE ONLY\"\nPublic: No specific label required\nreputation, violating \ncontractual \nrequirements, and \nposing an identity \ntheft risk.\n3 - \nCONFIDENT\nIAL (High)\nSensitive \ninformation.\nDictated internally \nby the company.\nMust be limited to \nonly authorized \nemployees, \ncontractors, and \nbusiness partners \nwith a specific \nbusiness need.\nSignificantImpact could \ninclude negatively \naffecting the \ncompany's \ncompetitive \nposition, damaging \nthe company's \nreputation, violating \ncontractual \nrequirements, and \nexposing the \ngeographic location \nof individuals.\nInternal memos, \nproprietary \nbusiness \ninformation, \ngeneral PII\n2 - \nINTERNAL \nUSE \n(Medium)\nNon-sensitive \ninformation.\nOriginating within \nor owned by the \ncompany, or \nentrusted to it by \nothers.\nMay be shared \nwith authorized \nemployees, \ncontractors, and \nbusiness partners \nwho have a \nbusiness need.\nModerateImpact could \ninclude damaging \nthe company's \nreputation and \nviolating contractual \nrequirements.\nInternal emails, \nproject documents\n1 - PUBLIC \n(Low)\nInformation \nthat has been \napproved for \nrelease to the \ngeneral public.\nFreely shareable \nboth internally and \nexternally.\nNo specific access \nrestrictions.\nNo damageImpact would not be \ndamaging or a risk \nto business \noperations.\nPress releases, \nmarketing \nmaterials\n\n3.3.3 Cloud Computing Environment\nWhen maintaining information and associated assets in the cloud computing environment, the cloud service customer is expected to label \nthese assets following the company's defined procedures for labeling. This may include the utilization of labeling functionalities provided by \nthe cloud service provider, where relevant. The cloud service provider is obliged to document and reveal any service functionality it offers, \nenabling the company to classify and label their information and associated assets.\nProper classification and labeling are crucial for maintaining the security of data. By categorizing data based on its sensitivity and applying \nappropriate labels, the company can ensure that data is handled correctly and securely, both within the organization and in cloud \nenvironments. This process helps protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of corporate and customer data.\n3.4 Handling Controls\nThe following handling controls are designed to ensure that data is protected according to its classification level. These controls outline the \nspecific requirements for various methods of data transmission, storage, and access to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability \nof the company's information. Each classification level requires different controls to address the potential impact of unauthorized access or \ndisclosure.\n4 - \nRESTRICTE\nD (Critical)\nRequired \nprior to \naccess by \nnon-\ncompany \nemployees \nEncryption \nRequired\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited \nEncryption \nRequired\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited\nRemote Access if \nNecessary (only \nwith VPN and \ntwo-factor \nauthorization \nwhen possible) \nEncryption \nRequired\nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nUse)\nPhysical \nAccess \nRestricted to \nSpecific \nIndividuals \nEncryption \nRequired\nRemote Wipe \nEnablement \nRequired, if \npossible \nEncryption \nRequired\nDo Not \nForward \nMark \"Open by \nAddressee \nOnly\"\nUse Courier or \n\"Certified Mail\" \nand Sealed, \nTamper-\nResistant \nEnvelopes for \nExternal \nMailings \n3 - \nCONFIDEN\nTIAL (High)\nRequired \nprior to \naccess by \nnon-\ncompany \nemployees \nEncryption \nRecommende\nd\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited \nEncryption \nRequired\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited\nRemote Access if \nNecessary (only \nEncryption \nRecommended\nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nUse)\nPhysical \nAccess \nRestricted to \nSpecific groups \nEncryption \nRequired\nRemote Wipe \nEnablement \nRequired, if \npossible \nEncryption \nRequired\nDo not \nForward \nMark \"Open by \nAddressee \nOnly\"\nUse \"Certified \nMail\" and \nSealed, \nTamper-\nResistant \nEnvelopes for \nExternal \nMailings \nClassificati\non / \nHandling \nControls\nNon-\nDisclosur\ne \nAgreemen\nt (NDA)\nInternal \nNetwork \nTransmissio\nn\nExternal \nNetwork \nTransmission\nData at RestMobile \nDevices\nEmailPhysical Mail\n\nLegend:\nClassification: The level of sensitivity assigned to the data.\nHandling Controls: Specifies the required security measures for handling data at different classification levels.\nNon-Disclosure Agreement (NDA): Indicates whether an NDA is required before granting access.\nInternal Network Transmission: Requirements for transmitting data over internal networks (wired & wireless).\nExternal Network Transmission: Requirements for transmitting data over external networks (wired & wireless).\nData at Rest: Requirements for storing data on file servers, databases, archives, etc.\nMobile Devices: Requirements for handling data on mobile devices (iPhone, iPad, USB Drive, etc.).\nEmail: Requirements for sending data via email (with and without attachments).\nPhysical Mail: Requirements for sending data via physical mail.\nwith VPN and \ntwo-factor \nauthorization \nwhen possible)\n2 - \nINTERNAL \nUSE \n(Medium)\nNot \nRequired \nNo \nRequirements \nEncryption \nRecommended\nInstant \nMessaging \nAllowed \n(Corporate Only)\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited \nEncryption \nRecommended\nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nUse)\nPhysical \nAccess \nRestricted to \nSpecific groups \nEncryption \nRecommended\nRemote Wipe \nEnablement \nRecommended\n, if possible \nExercising due \ncare\nNo \nRequirements \n1 - PUBLIC \n(Low)\nNot \nRequired \nNo \nRequirements \nNo special \nrequirements \nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nModification \nOnly)\nPhysical \nAccess \nUnrestricted \n(Unauthorized \nModification \nControls \nrecommended)\nNo \nRequirements \nNo \nRequirements \nUS Mail or \nOther Public \nDelivery \nSystems \n4 - \nRESTRICTE\nD (Critical)\nMay only be \naccessible to \nauthorized \npersons.\nExercisin\ng due \ncare\nForbiddenForbiddenOnly with the \nconsent of the \nauthor.\nExercising \ndue care\nPrinting must \nbe personally \nsupervised to \nprevent \nData carriers \nmust be \nhanded over \nto the IT \nClassificati\non / \nHandling \nControls\nPaperPhoneConversati\nons\nFaxChangeCopyPrintDestroy\n\nLegend:\nPaper: Requirements for storing and handling physical paper documents.\nPhone: Requirements for exchanging information over the phone.\nConversations: Guidelines for discussing information in public areas.\nFax: Requirements for sending information via fax.\nChange: Guidelines for changing information.\nCopy: Guidelines for copying information.\nPrint: Guidelines for printing information.\nDestroy: Guidelines for destroying information.\n3.5 Integrity\nIntegrity refers to ensuring the correctness (integrity) of data and the correct functioning of systems.

This data requires the highest level of protection due to its potential impact on the company \nand its customers if disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization.\nInternal Data: All data owned or licensed by the company. This data is intended for use within the organization and must be protected \nfrom unauthorized access, but it does not carry the same level of risk as Confidential/Restricted Data.\nPublic Information: Any information that is available within the public domain. This data has no existing local, national, or international \nlegal restrictions on access or usage and poses minimal risk to the company if disclosed or altered.\n\nThese definitions ensure a common understanding of data types and their respective sensitivity levels, which is crucial for implementing \nappropriate security measures and maintaining compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.\n3.1.2 Working Instructions\nThis working instruction is based on the guideline on the organization's assets and the classification scheme described therein.\nClassification Specification: The owner (editor) of the information should specify appropriate classification at the time of its creation.\nLabeling Responsibility: The author is responsible for the correct labeling of information.\nPeriodic Review: Where applicable, the owner should check periodically whether the information is still needed, and the classification is \nstill justified.\nAdoption of Existing Classifications: If an item of information has already been classified by another entity or a specific classification \nis required contractually, that classification must be adopted.\nPrinted Information Marking: Printed classified information shall be marked accordingly. The classification note \"internal use\" or \n\"confidential\" shall be placed on the title page and/or in the footer of the document.\nElectronic Information Tagging: Electronic information and data should be tagged with the available metadata.\nDevice Labeling: In order to keep the administrative effort within manageable limits, the devices carrying data are not labeled. \nEmployees are instructed to treat such devices and mobile devices as if they contained classified information.\nAccess Control: Access to information categorized as \"confidential\" is given on a \"need-to-know\" basis, i.e., an individual only receives \naccess to such information to the extent necessary for the performance of his or her work. Information categorized as \"internal use\" \nshould be available to employees by default.\nPrivileged Users: Classified information is only made available to privileged users. In the case of electronically stored information, \nappropriate authorizations must be assigned.\nSecurity of Devices: Devices carrying data and devices on which classified information is stored shall be kept securely locked or \npassword protected (e.g., employee laptops should not be locked, but should be password protected).\nData Deletion: If classified information on data carriers and devices is to be deleted, it should be done in line Asset Management Poli\ncy | 3.13 Disposal of Media and Devices and lead to the permanent destruction of such information.\nDefault Classification: Documents without a label should by default be treated as \"Internal Use\" unless they are marketing or sales \nmaterials or materials intended to be available publicly or for selected external parties (which should be verified with the document \nowner).\nThese generic requirements ensure that information is classified, labeled, reviewed, and protected appropriately, maintaining the security \nand integrity of the company's data throughout its lifecycle.\n3.2 Data Classification Scheme\nData classification, in the context of information security, is the classification of data based on its level of sensitivity and the impact to the \ncompany should that data be disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization. The classification of data helps determine what baseline \nsecurity controls are appropriate for safeguarding that data. All data should be classified into one of the following classifications:\n3.2.1 Confidential/Restricted Data\nData should be classified as Confidential/Restricted when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data could cause a \nserious or significant level of risk to the company or its customers. Examples of sensitive data include data protected by state or federal \nprivacy regulations (e.g., PHI & PII) and data protected by confidentiality agreements. The highest level of security controls should be \napplied to Confidential/Restricted Data:\nAccess Restrictions: Disclosure or access to Confidential/Restricted data is limited to specific use by individuals with a legitimate need-\nto-know. Explicit authorization by the CISO is required for access due to legal, contractual, privacy, or other constraints.\nProtection Measures: Must be protected to prevent loss, theft, unauthorized access, and/or unauthorized disclosure.\nData Destruction: Must be destroyed when no longer needed. Destruction must be in accordance with company policies and \nprocedures.\n\nIncident Response: Will require specific methodologies, procedures, and reporting requirements for the response and handling of \nincidents.\n3.2.2 Internal Use Data\nData should be classified as Internal Use when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data could result in a moderate \nlevel of risk to the company or its customers. This includes proprietary, ethical, or privacy considerations. Data must be protected from \nunauthorized access, modification, transmission, storage, or other use. This applies even though there may not be a civil statute requiring \nthis protection. Internal Use Data is restricted to personnel who have a legitimate reason to access it. By default, all data that is not explicitly \nclassified as Confidential/Restricted or Public data should be treated as Internal Use data. A reasonable level of security controls should be \napplied to Internal Use Data.\n3.2.3 Public Data\nData should be classified as Public when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data would result in little or no risk to \nthe company and its customers. It is further defined as information with no existing local, national, or international legal restrictions on \naccess or usage. While little or no controls are required to protect the confidentiality of Public data, some level of control is required to \nprevent unauthorized alteration or destruction of Public Data.\n3.2.4 De-identified Data\nThe company will de-identify data as a tool to remove personal information from data that it collects, uses, archives, and shares with other \norganizations. The de-identification process will allow the removal of direct identifiers, including all unique identifying numbers, \ncharacteristics, or codes. If a data set contains any amount or type of personal information, it will not be considered de-identified.\nThis data classification scheme ensures that all data handled by the company is appropriately classified based on its sensitivity and \npotential impact. By assigning one of the defined classifications, the company can implement suitable security controls to protect the data, \nthereby maintaining data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n3.3 Assessing Classification Level and Labeling\nThe goal of information security, as stated in the Information Security Policy, is to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of \nCorporate and Customer Data. Data classification reflects the level of impact to the company if confidentiality, integrity, or availability is \ncompromised.\n3.3.1 Classification Guidance\nIf a classification is not inherently obvious, consider each security objective using the following table as a guide. All data will be assigned one \nof the following four sensitivity levels:\n4 - \nRESTRICTE\nD (Critical)\nHighly \nsensitive \ninformation.\nDictated \nexternally by legal \nand/or contractual \nrequirements.\nMust be limited to \nonly authorized \nemployees, \ncontractors, and \nbusiness partners \nwith a specific \nbusiness need.\nSeriousImpact could \ninclude negatively \naffecting the \ncompany's \ncompetitive \nposition, violating \nregulatory \nrequirements, \ndamaging the \ncompany's \nPHI, sensitive PII, \nconfidential \nagreements\nClassificati\non\nDescriptionProtectionAccessDamageImpactExamples\n\nLegend:\nClassification: The level of sensitivity assigned to the data.\nDescription: An overview of the type of information and its sensitivity.\nProtection: The required level of protection based on legal, contractual, or internal policies.\nAccess: Who is allowed to access the data and under what conditions.\nDamage: The level of damage which would occur information were to become available to unauthorized parties.\nImpact: The potential consequences if the data were to be disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization.\nExamples: Typical examples of data that fall under each classification level.\n3.3.2 Labeling\nData must be labeled according to its classification to ensure proper handling. Labels should be clear and indicate the level of sensitivity. For \nexample:\nRestricted: \"CONFIDENTIAL/RESTRICTED\"\nConfidential: \"CONFIDENTIAL\"\nInternal Use: \"INTERNAL USE ONLY\"\nPublic: No specific label required\nreputation, violating \ncontractual \nrequirements, and \nposing an identity \ntheft risk.\n3 - \nCONFIDENT\nIAL (High)\nSensitive \ninformation.\nDictated internally \nby the company.\nMust be limited to \nonly authorized \nemployees, \ncontractors, and \nbusiness partners \nwith a specific \nbusiness need.\nSignificantImpact could \ninclude negatively \naffecting the \ncompany's \ncompetitive \nposition, damaging \nthe company's \nreputation, violating \ncontractual \nrequirements, and \nexposing the \ngeographic location \nof individuals.\nInternal memos, \nproprietary \nbusiness \ninformation, \ngeneral PII\n2 - \nINTERNAL \nUSE \n(Medium)\nNon-sensitive \ninformation.\nOriginating within \nor owned by the \ncompany, or \nentrusted to it by \nothers.\nMay be shared \nwith authorized \nemployees, \ncontractors, and \nbusiness partners \nwho have a \nbusiness need.\nModerateImpact could \ninclude damaging \nthe company's \nreputation and \nviolating contractual \nrequirements.\nInternal emails, \nproject documents\n1 - PUBLIC \n(Low)\nInformation \nthat has been \napproved for \nrelease to the \ngeneral public.\nFreely shareable \nboth internally and \nexternally.\nNo specific access \nrestrictions.\nNo damageImpact would not be \ndamaging or a risk \nto business \noperations.\nPress releases, \nmarketing \nmaterials\n\n3.3.3 Cloud Computing Environment\nWhen maintaining information and associated assets in the cloud computing environment, the cloud service customer is expected to label \nthese assets following the company's defined procedures for labeling. This may include the utilization of labeling functionalities provided by \nthe cloud service provider, where relevant. The cloud service provider is obliged to document and reveal any service functionality it offers, \nenabling the company to classify and label their information and associated assets.\nProper classification and labeling are crucial for maintaining the security of data. By categorizing data based on its sensitivity and applying \nappropriate labels, the company can ensure that data is handled correctly and securely, both within the organization and in cloud \nenvironments. This process helps protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of corporate and customer data.\n3.4 Handling Controls\nThe following handling controls are designed to ensure that data is protected according to its classification level. These controls outline the \nspecific requirements for various methods of data transmission, storage, and access to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability \nof the company's information. Each classification level requires different controls to address the potential impact of unauthorized access or \ndisclosure.\n4 - \nRESTRICTE\nD (Critical)\nRequired \nprior to \naccess by \nnon-\ncompany \nemployees \nEncryption \nRequired\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited \nEncryption \nRequired\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited\nRemote Access if \nNecessary (only \nwith VPN and \ntwo-factor \nauthorization \nwhen possible) \nEncryption \nRequired\nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nUse)\nPhysical \nAccess \nRestricted to \nSpecific \nIndividuals \nEncryption \nRequired\nRemote Wipe \nEnablement \nRequired, if \npossible \nEncryption \nRequired\nDo Not \nForward \nMark \"Open by \nAddressee \nOnly\"\nUse Courier or \n\"Certified Mail\" \nand Sealed, \nTamper-\nResistant \nEnvelopes for \nExternal \nMailings \n3 - \nCONFIDEN\nTIAL (High)\nRequired \nprior to \naccess by \nnon-\ncompany \nemployees \nEncryption \nRecommende\nd\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited \nEncryption \nRequired\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited\nRemote Access if \nNecessary (only \nEncryption \nRecommended\nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nUse)\nPhysical \nAccess \nRestricted to \nSpecific groups \nEncryption \nRequired\nRemote Wipe \nEnablement \nRequired, if \npossible \nEncryption \nRequired\nDo not \nForward \nMark \"Open by \nAddressee \nOnly\"\nUse \"Certified \nMail\" and \nSealed, \nTamper-\nResistant \nEnvelopes for \nExternal \nMailings \nClassificati\non / \nHandling \nControls\nNon-\nDisclosur\ne \nAgreemen\nt (NDA)\nInternal \nNetwork \nTransmissio\nn\nExternal \nNetwork \nTransmission\nData at RestMobile \nDevices\nEmailPhysical Mail\n\nLegend:\nClassification: The level of sensitivity assigned to the data.\nHandling Controls: Specifies the required security measures for handling data at different classification levels.\nNon-Disclosure Agreement (NDA): Indicates whether an NDA is required before granting access.\nInternal Network Transmission: Requirements for transmitting data over internal networks (wired & wireless).\nExternal Network Transmission: Requirements for transmitting data over external networks (wired & wireless).\nData at Rest: Requirements for storing data on file servers, databases, archives, etc.\nMobile Devices: Requirements for handling data on mobile devices (iPhone, iPad, USB Drive, etc.).\nEmail: Requirements for sending data via email (with and without attachments).\nPhysical Mail: Requirements for sending data via physical mail.\nwith VPN and \ntwo-factor \nauthorization \nwhen possible)\n2 - \nINTERNAL \nUSE \n(Medium)\nNot \nRequired \nNo \nRequirements \nEncryption \nRecommended\nInstant \nMessaging \nAllowed \n(Corporate Only)\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited \nEncryption \nRecommended\nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nUse)\nPhysical \nAccess \nRestricted to \nSpecific groups \nEncryption \nRecommended\nRemote Wipe \nEnablement \nRecommended\n, if possible \nExercising due \ncare\nNo \nRequirements \n1 - PUBLIC \n(Low)\nNot \nRequired \nNo \nRequirements \nNo special \nrequirements \nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nModification \nOnly)\nPhysical \nAccess \nUnrestricted \n(Unauthorized \nModification \nControls \nrecommended)\nNo \nRequirements \nNo \nRequirements \nUS Mail or \nOther Public \nDelivery \nSystems \n4 - \nRESTRICTE\nD (Critical)\nMay only be \naccessible to \nauthorized \npersons.\nExercisin\ng due \ncare\nForbiddenForbiddenOnly with the \nconsent of the \nauthor.\nExercising \ndue care\nPrinting must \nbe personally \nsupervised to \nprevent \nData carriers \nmust be \nhanded over \nto the IT \nClassificati\non / \nHandling \nControls\nPaperPhoneConversati\nons\nFaxChangeCopyPrintDestroy\n\nLegend:\nPaper: Requirements for storing and handling physical paper documents.\nPhone: Requirements for exchanging information over the phone.\nConversations: Guidelines for discussing information in public areas.\nFax: Requirements for sending information via fax.\nChange: Guidelines for changing information.\nCopy: Guidelines for copying information.\nPrint: Guidelines for printing information.\nDestroy: Guidelines for destroying information.\n3.5 Integrity\nIntegrity refers to ensuring the correctness (integrity) of data and the correct functioning of systems.
