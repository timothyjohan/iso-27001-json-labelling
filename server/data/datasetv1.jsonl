This data requires the highest level of protection due to its potential impact on the company \nand its customers if disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization.\nInternal Data: All data owned or licensed by the company. This data is intended for use within the organization and must be protected \nfrom unauthorized access, but it does not carry the same level of risk as Confidential/Restricted Data.\nPublic Information: Any information that is available within the public domain. This data has no existing local, national, or international \nlegal restrictions on access or usage and poses minimal risk to the company if disclosed or altered.\n\nThese definitions ensure a common understanding of data types and their respective sensitivity levels, which is crucial for implementing \nappropriate security measures and maintaining compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.\n3.1.2 Working Instructions\nThis working instruction is based on the guideline on the organization's assets and the classification scheme described therein.\nClassification Specification: The owner (editor) of the information should specify appropriate classification at the time of its creation.\nLabeling Responsibility: The author is responsible for the correct labeling of information.\nPeriodic Review: Where applicable, the owner should check periodically whether the information is still needed, and the classification is \nstill justified.\nAdoption of Existing Classifications: If an item of information has already been classified by another entity or a specific classification \nis required contractually, that classification must be adopted.\nPrinted Information Marking: Printed classified information shall be marked accordingly. The classification note \"internal use\" or \n\"confidential\" shall be placed on the title page and/or in the footer of the document.\nElectronic Information Tagging: Electronic information and data should be tagged with the available metadata.\nDevice Labeling: In order to keep the administrative effort within manageable limits, the devices carrying data are not labeled. \nEmployees are instructed to treat such devices and mobile devices as if they contained classified information.\nAccess Control: Access to information categorized as \"confidential\" is given on a \"need-to-know\" basis, i.e., an individual only receives \naccess to such information to the extent necessary for the performance of his or her work. Information categorized as \"internal use\" \nshould be available to employees by default.\nPrivileged Users: Classified information is only made available to privileged users. In the case of electronically stored information, \nappropriate authorizations must be assigned.\nSecurity of Devices: Devices carrying data and devices on which classified information is stored shall be kept securely locked or \npassword protected (e.g., employee laptops should not be locked, but should be password protected).\nData Deletion: If classified information on data carriers and devices is to be deleted, it should be done in line Asset Management Poli\ncy | 3.13 Disposal of Media and Devices and lead to the permanent destruction of such information.\nDefault Classification: Documents without a label should by default be treated as \"Internal Use\" unless they are marketing or sales \nmaterials or materials intended to be available publicly or for selected external parties (which should be verified with the document \nowner).\nThese generic requirements ensure that information is classified, labeled, reviewed, and protected appropriately, maintaining the security \nand integrity of the company's data throughout its lifecycle.\n3.2 Data Classification Scheme\nData classification, in the context of information security, is the classification of data based on its level of sensitivity and the impact to the \ncompany should that data be disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization. The classification of data helps determine what baseline \nsecurity controls are appropriate for safeguarding that data. All data should be classified into one of the following classifications:\n3.2.1 Confidential/Restricted Data\nData should be classified as Confidential/Restricted when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data could cause a \nserious or significant level of risk to the company or its customers. Examples of sensitive data include data protected by state or federal \nprivacy regulations (e.g., PHI & PII) and data protected by confidentiality agreements. The highest level of security controls should be \napplied to Confidential/Restricted Data:\nAccess Restrictions: Disclosure or access to Confidential/Restricted data is limited to specific use by individuals with a legitimate need-\nto-know. Explicit authorization by the CISO is required for access due to legal, contractual, privacy, or other constraints.\nProtection Measures: Must be protected to prevent loss, theft, unauthorized access, and/or unauthorized disclosure.\nData Destruction: Must be destroyed when no longer needed. Destruction must be in accordance with company policies and \nprocedures.\n\nIncident Response: Will require specific methodologies, procedures, and reporting requirements for the response and handling of \nincidents.\n3.2.2 Internal Use Data\nData should be classified as Internal Use when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data could result in a moderate \nlevel of risk to the company or its customers. This includes proprietary, ethical, or privacy considerations. Data must be protected from \nunauthorized access, modification, transmission, storage, or other use. This applies even though there may not be a civil statute requiring \nthis protection. Internal Use Data is restricted to personnel who have a legitimate reason to access it. By default, all data that is not explicitly \nclassified as Confidential/Restricted or Public data should be treated as Internal Use data. A reasonable level of security controls should be \napplied to Internal Use Data.\n3.2.3 Public Data\nData should be classified as Public when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data would result in little or no risk to \nthe company and its customers. It is further defined as information with no existing local, national, or international legal restrictions on \naccess or usage. While little or no controls are required to protect the confidentiality of Public data, some level of control is required to \nprevent unauthorized alteration or destruction of Public Data.\n3.2.4 De-identified Data\nThe company will de-identify data as a tool to remove personal information from data that it collects, uses, archives, and shares with other \norganizations. The de-identification process will allow the removal of direct identifiers, including all unique identifying numbers, \ncharacteristics, or codes. If a data set contains any amount or type of personal information, it will not be considered de-identified.\nThis data classification scheme ensures that all data handled by the company is appropriately classified based on its sensitivity and \npotential impact. By assigning one of the defined classifications, the company can implement suitable security controls to protect the data, \nthereby maintaining data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n3.3 Assessing Classification Level and Labeling\nThe goal of information security, as stated in the Information Security Policy, is to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of \nCorporate and Customer Data. Data classification reflects the level of impact to the company if confidentiality, integrity, or availability is \ncompromised.\n3.3.1 Classification Guidance\nIf a classification is not inherently obvious, consider each security objective using the following table as a guide. All data will be assigned one \nof the following four sensitivity levels:\n4 - \nRESTRICTE\nD (Critical)\nHighly \nsensitive \ninformation.\nDictated \nexternally by legal \nand/or contractual \nrequirements.\nMust be limited to \nonly authorized \nemployees, \ncontractors, and \nbusiness partners \nwith a specific \nbusiness need.\nSeriousImpact could \ninclude negatively \naffecting the \ncompany's \ncompetitive \nposition, violating \nregulatory \nrequirements, \ndamaging the \ncompany's \nPHI, sensitive PII, \nconfidential \nagreements\nClassificati\non\nDescriptionProtectionAccessDamageImpactExamples\n\nLegend:\nClassification: The level of sensitivity assigned to the data.\nDescription: An overview of the type of information and its sensitivity.\nProtection: The required level of protection based on legal, contractual, or internal policies.\nAccess: Who is allowed to access the data and under what conditions.\nDamage: The level of damage which would occur information were to become available to unauthorized parties.\nImpact: The potential consequences if the data were to be disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization.\nExamples: Typical examples of data that fall under each classification level.\n3.3.2 Labeling\nData must be labeled according to its classification to ensure proper handling. Labels should be clear and indicate the level of sensitivity. For \nexample:\nRestricted: \"CONFIDENTIAL/RESTRICTED\"\nConfidential: \"CONFIDENTIAL\"\nInternal Use: \"INTERNAL USE ONLY\"\nPublic: No specific label required\nreputation, violating \ncontractual \nrequirements, and \nposing an identity \ntheft risk.\n3 - \nCONFIDENT\nIAL (High)\nSensitive \ninformation.\nDictated internally \nby the company.\nMust be limited to \nonly authorized \nemployees, \ncontractors, and \nbusiness partners \nwith a specific \nbusiness need.\nSignificantImpact could \ninclude negatively \naffecting the \ncompany's \ncompetitive \nposition, damaging \nthe company's \nreputation, violating \ncontractual \nrequirements, and \nexposing the \ngeographic location \nof individuals.\nInternal memos, \nproprietary \nbusiness \ninformation, \ngeneral PII\n2 - \nINTERNAL \nUSE \n(Medium)\nNon-sensitive \ninformation.\nOriginating within \nor owned by the \ncompany, or \nentrusted to it by \nothers.\nMay be shared \nwith authorized \nemployees, \ncontractors, and \nbusiness partners \nwho have a \nbusiness need.\nModerateImpact could \ninclude damaging \nthe company's \nreputation and \nviolating contractual \nrequirements.\nInternal emails, \nproject documents\n1 - PUBLIC \n(Low)\nInformation \nthat has been \napproved for \nrelease to the \ngeneral public.\nFreely shareable \nboth internally and \nexternally.\nNo specific access \nrestrictions.\nNo damageImpact would not be \ndamaging or a risk \nto business \noperations.\nPress releases, \nmarketing \nmaterials\n\n3.3.3 Cloud Computing Environment\nWhen maintaining information and associated assets in the cloud computing environment, the cloud service customer is expected to label \nthese assets following the company's defined procedures for labeling. This may include the utilization of labeling functionalities provided by \nthe cloud service provider, where relevant. The cloud service provider is obliged to document and reveal any service functionality it offers, \nenabling the company to classify and label their information and associated assets.\nProper classification and labeling are crucial for maintaining the security of data. By categorizing data based on its sensitivity and applying \nappropriate labels, the company can ensure that data is handled correctly and securely, both within the organization and in cloud \nenvironments. This process helps protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of corporate and customer data.\n3.4 Handling Controls\nThe following handling controls are designed to ensure that data is protected according to its classification level. These controls outline the \nspecific requirements for various methods of data transmission, storage, and access to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability \nof the company's information. Each classification level requires different controls to address the potential impact of unauthorized access or \ndisclosure.\n4 - \nRESTRICTE\nD (Critical)\nRequired \nprior to \naccess by \nnon-\ncompany \nemployees \nEncryption \nRequired\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited \nEncryption \nRequired\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited\nRemote Access if \nNecessary (only \nwith VPN and \ntwo-factor \nauthorization \nwhen possible) \nEncryption \nRequired\nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nUse)\nPhysical \nAccess \nRestricted to \nSpecific \nIndividuals \nEncryption \nRequired\nRemote Wipe \nEnablement \nRequired, if \npossible \nEncryption \nRequired\nDo Not \nForward \nMark \"Open by \nAddressee \nOnly\"\nUse Courier or \n\"Certified Mail\" \nand Sealed, \nTamper-\nResistant \nEnvelopes for \nExternal \nMailings \n3 - \nCONFIDEN\nTIAL (High)\nRequired \nprior to \naccess by \nnon-\ncompany \nemployees \nEncryption \nRecommende\nd\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited \nEncryption \nRequired\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited\nRemote Access if \nNecessary (only \nEncryption \nRecommended\nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nUse)\nPhysical \nAccess \nRestricted to \nSpecific groups \nEncryption \nRequired\nRemote Wipe \nEnablement \nRequired, if \npossible \nEncryption \nRequired\nDo not \nForward \nMark \"Open by \nAddressee \nOnly\"\nUse \"Certified \nMail\" and \nSealed, \nTamper-\nResistant \nEnvelopes for \nExternal \nMailings \nClassificati\non / \nHandling \nControls\nNon-\nDisclosur\ne \nAgreemen\nt (NDA)\nInternal \nNetwork \nTransmissio\nn\nExternal \nNetwork \nTransmission\nData at RestMobile \nDevices\nEmailPhysical Mail\n\nLegend:\nClassification: The level of sensitivity assigned to the data.\nHandling Controls: Specifies the required security measures for handling data at different classification levels.\nNon-Disclosure Agreement (NDA): Indicates whether an NDA is required before granting access.\nInternal Network Transmission: Requirements for transmitting data over internal networks (wired & wireless).\nExternal Network Transmission: Requirements for transmitting data over external networks (wired & wireless).\nData at Rest: Requirements for storing data on file servers, databases, archives, etc.\nMobile Devices: Requirements for handling data on mobile devices (iPhone, iPad, USB Drive, etc.).\nEmail: Requirements for sending data via email (with and without attachments).\nPhysical Mail: Requirements for sending data via physical mail.\nwith VPN and \ntwo-factor \nauthorization \nwhen possible)\n2 - \nINTERNAL \nUSE \n(Medium)\nNot \nRequired \nNo \nRequirements \nEncryption \nRecommended\nInstant \nMessaging \nAllowed \n(Corporate Only)\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited \nEncryption \nRecommended\nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nUse)\nPhysical \nAccess \nRestricted to \nSpecific groups \nEncryption \nRecommended\nRemote Wipe \nEnablement \nRecommended\n, if possible \nExercising due \ncare\nNo \nRequirements \n1 - PUBLIC \n(Low)\nNot \nRequired \nNo \nRequirements \nNo special \nrequirements \nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nModification \nOnly)\nPhysical \nAccess \nUnrestricted \n(Unauthorized \nModification \nControls \nrecommended)\nNo \nRequirements \nNo \nRequirements \nUS Mail or \nOther Public \nDelivery \nSystems \n4 - \nRESTRICTE\nD (Critical)\nMay only be \naccessible to \nauthorized \npersons.\nExercisin\ng due \ncare\nForbiddenForbiddenOnly with the \nconsent of the \nauthor.\nExercising \ndue care\nPrinting must \nbe personally \nsupervised to \nprevent \nData carriers \nmust be \nhanded over \nto the IT \nClassificati\non / \nHandling \nControls\nPaperPhoneConversati\nons\nFaxChangeCopyPrintDestroy\n\nLegend:\nPaper: Requirements for storing and handling physical paper documents.\nPhone: Requirements for exchanging information over the phone.\nConversations: Guidelines for discussing information in public areas.\nFax: Requirements for sending information via fax.\nChange: Guidelines for changing information.\nCopy: Guidelines for copying information.\nPrint: Guidelines for printing information.\nDestroy: Guidelines for destroying information.\n3.5 Integrity\nIntegrity refers to ensuring the correctness (integrity) of data and the correct functioning of systems.

This data requires the highest level of protection due to its potential impact on the company \nand its customers if disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization.\nInternal Data: All data owned or licensed by the company. This data is intended for use within the organization and must be protected \nfrom unauthorized access, but it does not carry the same level of risk as Confidential/Restricted Data.\nPublic Information: Any information that is available within the public domain. This data has no existing local, national, or international \nlegal restrictions on access or usage and poses minimal risk to the company if disclosed or altered.\n\nThese definitions ensure a common understanding of data types and their respective sensitivity levels, which is crucial for implementing \nappropriate security measures and maintaining compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.\n3.1.2 Working Instructions\nThis working instruction is based on the guideline on the organization's assets and the classification scheme described therein.\nClassification Specification: The owner (editor) of the information should specify appropriate classification at the time of its creation.\nLabeling Responsibility: The author is responsible for the correct labeling of information.\nPeriodic Review: Where applicable, the owner should check periodically whether the information is still needed, and the classification is \nstill justified.\nAdoption of Existing Classifications: If an item of information has already been classified by another entity or a specific classification \nis required contractually, that classification must be adopted.\nPrinted Information Marking: Printed classified information shall be marked accordingly. The classification note \"internal use\" or \n\"confidential\" shall be placed on the title page and/or in the footer of the document.\nElectronic Information Tagging: Electronic information and data should be tagged with the available metadata.\nDevice Labeling: In order to keep the administrative effort within manageable limits, the devices carrying data are not labeled. \nEmployees are instructed to treat such devices and mobile devices as if they contained classified information.\nAccess Control: Access to information categorized as \"confidential\" is given on a \"need-to-know\" basis, i.e., an individual only receives \naccess to such information to the extent necessary for the performance of his or her work. Information categorized as \"internal use\" \nshould be available to employees by default.\nPrivileged Users: Classified information is only made available to privileged users. In the case of electronically stored information, \nappropriate authorizations must be assigned.\nSecurity of Devices: Devices carrying data and devices on which classified information is stored shall be kept securely locked or \npassword protected (e.g., employee laptops should not be locked, but should be password protected).\nData Deletion: If classified information on data carriers and devices is to be deleted, it should be done in line Asset Management Poli\ncy | 3.13 Disposal of Media and Devices and lead to the permanent destruction of such information.\nDefault Classification: Documents without a label should by default be treated as \"Internal Use\" unless they are marketing or sales \nmaterials or materials intended to be available publicly or for selected external parties (which should be verified with the document \nowner).\nThese generic requirements ensure that information is classified, labeled, reviewed, and protected appropriately, maintaining the security \nand integrity of the company's data throughout its lifecycle.\n3.2 Data Classification Scheme\nData classification, in the context of information security, is the classification of data based on its level of sensitivity and the impact to the \ncompany should that data be disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization. The classification of data helps determine what baseline \nsecurity controls are appropriate for safeguarding that data. All data should be classified into one of the following classifications:\n3.2.1 Confidential/Restricted Data\nData should be classified as Confidential/Restricted when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data could cause a \nserious or significant level of risk to the company or its customers. Examples of sensitive data include data protected by state or federal \nprivacy regulations (e.g., PHI & PII) and data protected by confidentiality agreements. The highest level of security controls should be \napplied to Confidential/Restricted Data:\nAccess Restrictions: Disclosure or access to Confidential/Restricted data is limited to specific use by individuals with a legitimate need-\nto-know. Explicit authorization by the CISO is required for access due to legal, contractual, privacy, or other constraints.\nProtection Measures: Must be protected to prevent loss, theft, unauthorized access, and/or unauthorized disclosure.\nData Destruction: Must be destroyed when no longer needed. Destruction must be in accordance with company policies and \nprocedures.\n\nIncident Response: Will require specific methodologies, procedures, and reporting requirements for the response and handling of \nincidents.\n3.2.2 Internal Use Data\nData should be classified as Internal Use when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data could result in a moderate \nlevel of risk to the company or its customers. This includes proprietary, ethical, or privacy considerations. Data must be protected from \nunauthorized access, modification, transmission, storage, or other use. This applies even though there may not be a civil statute requiring \nthis protection. Internal Use Data is restricted to personnel who have a legitimate reason to access it. By default, all data that is not explicitly \nclassified as Confidential/Restricted or Public data should be treated as Internal Use data. A reasonable level of security controls should be \napplied to Internal Use Data.\n3.2.3 Public Data\nData should be classified as Public when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data would result in little or no risk to \nthe company and its customers. It is further defined as information with no existing local, national, or international legal restrictions on \naccess or usage. While little or no controls are required to protect the confidentiality of Public data, some level of control is required to \nprevent unauthorized alteration or destruction of Public Data.\n3.2.4 De-identified Data\nThe company will de-identify data as a tool to remove personal information from data that it collects, uses, archives, and shares with other \norganizations. The de-identification process will allow the removal of direct identifiers, including all unique identifying numbers, \ncharacteristics, or codes. If a data set contains any amount or type of personal information, it will not be considered de-identified.\nThis data classification scheme ensures that all data handled by the company is appropriately classified based on its sensitivity and \npotential impact. By assigning one of the defined classifications, the company can implement suitable security controls to protect the data, \nthereby maintaining data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n3.3 Assessing Classification Level and Labeling\nThe goal of information security, as stated in the Information Security Policy, is to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of \nCorporate and Customer Data. Data classification reflects the level of impact to the company if confidentiality, integrity, or availability is \ncompromised.\n3.3.1 Classification Guidance\nIf a classification is not inherently obvious, consider each security objective using the following table as a guide. All data will be assigned one \nof the following four sensitivity levels:\n4 - \nRESTRICTE\nD (Critical)\nHighly \nsensitive \ninformation.\nDictated \nexternally by legal \nand/or contractual \nrequirements.\nMust be limited to \nonly authorized \nemployees, \ncontractors, and \nbusiness partners \nwith a specific \nbusiness need.\nSeriousImpact could \ninclude negatively \naffecting the \ncompany's \ncompetitive \nposition, violating \nregulatory \nrequirements, \ndamaging the \ncompany's \nPHI, sensitive PII, \nconfidential \nagreements\nClassificati\non\nDescriptionProtectionAccessDamageImpactExamples\n\nLegend:\nClassification: The level of sensitivity assigned to the data.\nDescription: An overview of the type of information and its sensitivity.\nProtection: The required level of protection based on legal, contractual, or internal policies.\nAccess: Who is allowed to access the data and under what conditions.\nDamage: The level of damage which would occur information were to become available to unauthorized parties.\nImpact: The potential consequences if the data were to be disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization.\nExamples: Typical examples of data that fall under each classification level.\n3.3.2 Labeling\nData must be labeled according to its classification to ensure proper handling. Labels should be clear and indicate the level of sensitivity. For \nexample:\nRestricted: \"CONFIDENTIAL/RESTRICTED\"\nConfidential: \"CONFIDENTIAL\"\nInternal Use: \"INTERNAL USE ONLY\"\nPublic: No specific label required\nreputation, violating \ncontractual \nrequirements, and \nposing an identity \ntheft risk.\n3 - \nCONFIDENT\nIAL (High)\nSensitive \ninformation.\nDictated internally \nby the company.\nMust be limited to \nonly authorized \nemployees, \ncontractors, and \nbusiness partners \nwith a specific \nbusiness need.\nSignificantImpact could \ninclude negatively \naffecting the \ncompany's \ncompetitive \nposition, damaging \nthe company's \nreputation, violating \ncontractual \nrequirements, and \nexposing the \ngeographic location \nof individuals.\nInternal memos, \nproprietary \nbusiness \ninformation, \ngeneral PII\n2 - \nINTERNAL \nUSE \n(Medium)\nNon-sensitive \ninformation.\nOriginating within \nor owned by the \ncompany, or \nentrusted to it by \nothers.\nMay be shared \nwith authorized \nemployees, \ncontractors, and \nbusiness partners \nwho have a \nbusiness need.\nModerateImpact could \ninclude damaging \nthe company's \nreputation and \nviolating contractual \nrequirements.\nInternal emails, \nproject documents\n1 - PUBLIC \n(Low)\nInformation \nthat has been \napproved for \nrelease to the \ngeneral public.\nFreely shareable \nboth internally and \nexternally.\nNo specific access \nrestrictions.\nNo damageImpact would not be \ndamaging or a risk \nto business \noperations.\nPress releases, \nmarketing \nmaterials\n\n3.3.3 Cloud Computing Environment\nWhen maintaining information and associated assets in the cloud computing environment, the cloud service customer is expected to label \nthese assets following the company's defined procedures for labeling. This may include the utilization of labeling functionalities provided by \nthe cloud service provider, where relevant. The cloud service provider is obliged to document and reveal any service functionality it offers, \nenabling the company to classify and label their information and associated assets.\nProper classification and labeling are crucial for maintaining the security of data. By categorizing data based on its sensitivity and applying \nappropriate labels, the company can ensure that data is handled correctly and securely, both within the organization and in cloud \nenvironments. This process helps protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of corporate and customer data.\n3.4 Handling Controls\nThe following handling controls are designed to ensure that data is protected according to its classification level. These controls outline the \nspecific requirements for various methods of data transmission, storage, and access to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability \nof the company's information. Each classification level requires different controls to address the potential impact of unauthorized access or \ndisclosure.\n4 - \nRESTRICTE\nD (Critical)\nRequired \nprior to \naccess by \nnon-\ncompany \nemployees \nEncryption \nRequired\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited \nEncryption \nRequired\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited\nRemote Access if \nNecessary (only \nwith VPN and \ntwo-factor \nauthorization \nwhen possible) \nEncryption \nRequired\nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nUse)\nPhysical \nAccess \nRestricted to \nSpecific \nIndividuals \nEncryption \nRequired\nRemote Wipe \nEnablement \nRequired, if \npossible \nEncryption \nRequired\nDo Not \nForward \nMark \"Open by \nAddressee \nOnly\"\nUse Courier or \n\"Certified Mail\" \nand Sealed, \nTamper-\nResistant \nEnvelopes for \nExternal \nMailings \n3 - \nCONFIDEN\nTIAL (High)\nRequired \nprior to \naccess by \nnon-\ncompany \nemployees \nEncryption \nRecommende\nd\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited \nEncryption \nRequired\nInstant \nMessaging \nProhibited\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited\nRemote Access if \nNecessary (only \nEncryption \nRecommended\nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nUse)\nPhysical \nAccess \nRestricted to \nSpecific groups \nEncryption \nRequired\nRemote Wipe \nEnablement \nRequired, if \npossible \nEncryption \nRequired\nDo not \nForward \nMark \"Open by \nAddressee \nOnly\"\nUse \"Certified \nMail\" and \nSealed, \nTamper-\nResistant \nEnvelopes for \nExternal \nMailings \nClassificati\non / \nHandling \nControls\nNon-\nDisclosur\ne \nAgreemen\nt (NDA)\nInternal \nNetwork \nTransmissio\nn\nExternal \nNetwork \nTransmission\nData at RestMobile \nDevices\nEmailPhysical Mail\n\nLegend:\nClassification: The level of sensitivity assigned to the data.\nHandling Controls: Specifies the required security measures for handling data at different classification levels.\nNon-Disclosure Agreement (NDA): Indicates whether an NDA is required before granting access.\nInternal Network Transmission: Requirements for transmitting data over internal networks (wired & wireless).\nExternal Network Transmission: Requirements for transmitting data over external networks (wired & wireless).\nData at Rest: Requirements for storing data on file servers, databases, archives, etc.\nMobile Devices: Requirements for handling data on mobile devices (iPhone, iPad, USB Drive, etc.).\nEmail: Requirements for sending data via email (with and without attachments).\nPhysical Mail: Requirements for sending data via physical mail.\nwith VPN and \ntwo-factor \nauthorization \nwhen possible)\n2 - \nINTERNAL \nUSE \n(Medium)\nNot \nRequired \nNo \nRequirements \nEncryption \nRecommended\nInstant \nMessaging \nAllowed \n(Corporate Only)\nInsecure \nTransfer \nProtocols \nProhibited \nEncryption \nRecommended\nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nUse)\nPhysical \nAccess \nRestricted to \nSpecific groups \nEncryption \nRecommended\nRemote Wipe \nEnablement \nRecommended\n, if possible \nExercising due \ncare\nNo \nRequirements \n1 - PUBLIC \n(Low)\nNot \nRequired \nNo \nRequirements \nNo special \nrequirements \nLogical Access \nControls \nRequired (Limit \nUnauthorized \nModification \nOnly)\nPhysical \nAccess \nUnrestricted \n(Unauthorized \nModification \nControls \nrecommended)\nNo \nRequirements \nNo \nRequirements \nUS Mail or \nOther Public \nDelivery \nSystems \n4 - \nRESTRICTE\nD (Critical)\nMay only be \naccessible to \nauthorized \npersons.\nExercisin\ng due \ncare\nForbiddenForbiddenOnly with the \nconsent of the \nauthor.\nExercising \ndue care\nPrinting must \nbe personally \nsupervised to \nprevent \nData carriers \nmust be \nhanded over \nto the IT \nClassificati\non / \nHandling \nControls\nPaperPhoneConversati\nons\nFaxChangeCopyPrintDestroy\n\nLegend:\nPaper: Requirements for storing and handling physical paper documents.\nPhone: Requirements for exchanging information over the phone.\nConversations: Guidelines for discussing information in public areas.\nFax: Requirements for sending information via fax.\nChange: Guidelines for changing information.\nCopy: Guidelines for copying information.\nPrint: Guidelines for printing information.\nDestroy: Guidelines for destroying information.\n3.5 Integrity\nIntegrity refers to ensuring the correctness (integrity) of data and the correct functioning of systems.

facilities, infrastructure, and sensitive data based on a risk-\nbased approach and implemented where feasible. \nAccess Restriction: Physical access to the company's secure facilities, such as server rooms and critical infrastructure, is restricted to \nauthorized personnel only. In remote locations, employees are responsible for securing access to company resources through digital \nmeans, such as VPNs and secure login systems.\nEmployee Identification: In secure controlled facilities, employees are required to wear identification badges to distinguish themselves \nas authorized personnel. In remote environments, this control may not be applicable but should be supplemented by other identity \nverification methods where necessary.\nVisitor Management: Visitors and vendors must be escorted by an authorized employee at all times while on company premises. Visitor \naccess may not be applicable in remote locations, but employees are required to ensure the confidentiality and security of any sensitive \ninformation.\nIncident Reporting: All workforce members are responsible for reporting unauthorized visitors or access attempts to company facilities \nor systems. This includes both physical locations and remote work environments. Reporting should be immediate to the Security Officer \nor Facility Manager.\nRecord-Keeping: It is recommended to retain a detailed record of each physical access, including visits, maintenance, and repairs \nwhere feasible.\nGiven the remote nature of many locations, physical controls will be implemented flexibly based on an assessment of the risks involved in \neach environment.\n3.2 Access Requirements\nPhysical access to secure facilities is managed through badge readers, smart locks, and physical keys. In environments where these \ncontrols are not applicable, such as coworking spaces, alternative security measures based on risk assessments will be applied.\nBadge and Key Management: Access to the company's badge and key systems is restricted to authorized personnel based on a need-\nto-know basis. Workforce members must report lost or stolen keys or badges immediately to their manager, and the Facility Manager \nmust re-provision access or change locks within 7 days.\nRestricted Areas: Secure areas, such as server rooms, must be locked when unattended, and access is granted only to authorized \nemployees. In remote or coworking environments, employees must ensure their devices and sensitive information are secured.\nVisitor Controls: Visitors must sign a log upon entering secure facilities, indicating the date, time, purpose, and point of contact. Visitor \nlogs must be kept for at least 3 months. In remote environments, visitor controls may not be applicable but should be replaced by strong \ndigital access controls.\nLoading and Delivery Areas: Access to loading and delivery areas is restricted to authorized personnel, and shipments should be \ninspected according to Asset Management procedures. In remote locations, this control may not be necessary but should be considered \nif the location handles sensitive assets.\n3.3 Maintenance and Monitoring\nContinuous monitoring and maintenance of physical security systems are crucial for protecting the company's assets. These requirements \napply primarily to formal company locations, while remote work environments may not require such stringent controls.\nMany of the company's operations take place either in its own offices or remotely, including at home, in cafes, or coworking spaces. \nThe company's own offices may also be considered as remote locations in certain contexts.\nAs a result, certain physical security controls, such as badge systems or visitor logs, may not be applicable to all environments. \nSecurity measures will be applied based on a risk-based approach and implemented where feasible. The specific controls \nimplemented will vary depending on the location and the nature of the activities being conducted there.\n\nMaintenance of Security Equipment: Any repairs or maintenance to physical security equipment, including locks, cameras, and access \ncontrol systems, must be documented, with records retained for at least seven years.\nCCTV Monitoring: Secure areas must be monitored by CCTV, with recordings stored for at least 3 months. For remote locations, \nemployees are responsible for ensuring security through digital means, such as monitoring login activity and using endpoint security \nmeasures.\nAlarm Systems: Alarm systems must be installed in critical areas and tested regularly. In remote work environments, employees should \nensure the security of their workspace, devices, and data through encryption and secure access controls.\n3.4 Workstation Security\nWorkstation security is essential to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive company data. In formal facilities, workstations are protected \nby physical and technical safeguards, while in remote locations, employees must follow strict digital security measures.\nAccess to Workstations: Only authorized employees may access company-owned workstations, and these devices must be used \nsolely for business purposes. Workstations must be locked or logged off when left unattended.\nPhysical Safeguards: In shared or open workspaces, workstations must be positioned to prevent unauthorized viewing of sensitive \ninformation. Employees should use privacy filters or position screens away from public view.\nPortable Device Security: Laptops and other portable devices containing sensitive information must be secured when left unattended, \nusing cable locks or locked storage. Employees in remote environments must also adhere to the company's Encryption Policy.\n3.5 Visitor and Vendor Management\nVisitor and vendor access to company facilities must be tightly controlled, though these measures may not be applicable in remote work \nenvironments.\nEscort Requirement: Visitors and vendors must be escorted by an authorized company employee while on the premises. Remote \nenvironments, such as cafes, may not have the need for physical escorts, but sensitive data must be protected.\nVisitor Badges: Visitors in formal company locations must wear badges that distinguish them from employees. These badges must be \nreturned when leaving the facility.\nVisitor Logs: Logs documenting visitor access, including date, time, and purpose, must be maintained for at least 3 months. In remote \nenvironments, visitor logs may not apply, but employees must ensure secure access to any shared devices or data.\n3.6 Data Center and Building Standards\nThe company does not maintain its own data centers and instead relies on cloud infrastructure providers such as AWS and Azure. However, \nany physical infrastructure under the company's control must adhere to high security standards.\nSecurity Perimeters: Secure perimeters must be established around areas containing critical data or infrastructure. Entry points should \nbe protected with access controls and monitored by surveillance cameras.\nCCTV Monitoring: Critical areas must be monitored by CCTV, and recordings must be kept for at least 3 months.\nBackup Power: Backup power supplies, such as UPS systems, must be available for critical infrastructure to ensure continuous \noperations during power outages.\nEmergency Power Shut-off: Emergency power shut-off switches must be located near exits in critical equipment rooms to allow for \nrapid shutdown during emergencies.\n3.7 Enforcement of Facility Access Policies\nTo ensure compliance with security policies, violations of these controls will result in investigation and potential disciplinary actions.\nIncident Reporting: Employees, visitors, and vendors must report any violations of physical security policies to their manager or the \nSecurity Officer immediately.\n\nDisciplinary Actions: Employees found violating these policies may face disciplinary actions, up to and including termination. Visitors \nand vendors may have their access privileges revoked.\nIn remote environments, security measures may be adapted based on risk assessments, but all employees are responsible for safeguarding \ncompany data and resources. Non-compliance will be investigated and addressed accordingly.\n4 Document Administration\n4.1 Ownership and Review\n  \n4.2 Monitoring and Enforcement\n4.3 Related Documents\n4.3.1 Internal documents\nInformation Security Policy \nInformation Security Organization Policy\n4.4 Approvals\n4.5 Revision History\nFollow the link for details of revisions. \nThe Document Owner owns this Document and is responsible for reviewing the Document for updates annually, or following any major \nchanges to Squirro AG's compliance environment.

facilities, infrastructure, and sensitive data based on a risk-\nbased approach and implemented where feasible. \nAccess Restriction: Physical access to the company's secure facilities, such as server rooms and critical infrastructure, is restricted to \nauthorized personnel only. In remote locations, employees are responsible for securing access to company resources through digital \nmeans, such as VPNs and secure login systems.\nEmployee Identification: In secure controlled facilities, employees are required to wear identification badges to distinguish themselves \nas authorized personnel. In remote environments, this control may not be applicable but should be supplemented by other identity \nverification methods where necessary.\nVisitor Management: Visitors and vendors must be escorted by an authorized employee at all times while on company premises. Visitor \naccess may not be applicable in remote locations, but employees are required to ensure the confidentiality and security of any sensitive \ninformation.\nIncident Reporting: All workforce members are responsible for reporting unauthorized visitors or access attempts to company facilities \nor systems. This includes both physical locations and remote work environments. Reporting should be immediate to the Security Officer \nor Facility Manager.\nRecord-Keeping: It is recommended to retain a detailed record of each physical access, including visits, maintenance, and repairs \nwhere feasible.\nGiven the remote nature of many locations, physical controls will be implemented flexibly based on an assessment of the risks involved in \neach environment.\n3.2 Access Requirements\nPhysical access to secure facilities is managed through badge readers, smart locks, and physical keys. In environments where these \ncontrols are not applicable, such as coworking spaces, alternative security measures based on risk assessments will be applied.\nBadge and Key Management: Access to the company's badge and key systems is restricted to authorized personnel based on a need-\nto-know basis. Workforce members must report lost or stolen keys or badges immediately to their manager, and the Facility Manager \nmust re-provision access or change locks within 7 days.\nRestricted Areas: Secure areas, such as server rooms, must be locked when unattended, and access is granted only to authorized \nemployees.

facilities, infrastructure, and sensitive data based on a risk-\nbased approach and implemented where feasible. \nAccess Restriction: Physical access to the company's secure facilities, such as server rooms and critical infrastructure, is restricted to \nauthorized personnel only. In remote locations, employees are responsible for securing access to company resources through digital \nmeans, such as VPNs and secure login systems.\nEmployee Identification: In secure controlled facilities, employees are required to wear identification badges to distinguish themselves \nas authorized personnel. In remote environments, this control may not be applicable but should be supplemented by other identity \nverification methods where necessary.\nVisitor Management: Visitors and vendors must be escorted by an authorized employee at all times while on company premises. Visitor \naccess may not be applicable in remote locations, but employees are required to ensure the confidentiality and security of any sensitive \ninformation.\nIncident Reporting: All workforce members are responsible for reporting unauthorized visitors or access attempts to company facilities \nor systems. This includes both physical locations and remote work environments. Reporting should be immediate to the Security Officer \nor Facility Manager.\nRecord-Keeping: It is recommended to retain a detailed record of each physical access, including visits, maintenance, and repairs \nwhere feasible.\nGiven the remote nature of many locations, physical controls will be implemented flexibly based on an assessment of the risks involved in \neach environment.\n3.2 Access Requirements\nPhysical access to secure facilities is managed through badge readers, smart locks, and physical keys. In environments where these \ncontrols are not applicable, such as coworking spaces, alternative security measures based on risk assessments will be applied.\nBadge and Key Management: Access to the company's badge and key systems is restricted to authorized personnel based on a need-\nto-know basis. Workforce members must report lost or stolen keys or badges immediately to their manager, and the Facility Manager \nmust re-provision access or change locks within 7 days.\nRestricted Areas: Secure areas, such as server rooms, must be locked when unattended, and access is granted only to authorized \nemployees. In remote or coworking environments, employees must ensure their devices and sensitive information are secured.\nVisitor Controls: Visitors must sign a log upon entering secure facilities, indicating the date, time, purpose, and point of contact. Visitor \nlogs must be kept for at least 3 months. In remote environments, visitor controls may not be applicable but should be replaced by strong \ndigital access controls.\nLoading and Delivery Areas: Access to loading and delivery areas is restricted to authorized personnel, and shipments should be \ninspected according to Asset Management procedures. In remote locations, this control may not be necessary but should be considered \nif the location handles sensitive assets.\n3.3 Maintenance and Monitoring\nContinuous monitoring and maintenance of physical security systems are crucial for protecting the company's assets. These requirements \napply primarily to formal company locations, while remote work environments may not require such stringent controls.\nMany of the company's operations take place either in its own offices or remotely, including at home, in cafes, or coworking spaces. \nThe company's own offices may also be considered as remote locations in certain contexts.\nAs a result, certain physical security controls, such as badge systems or visitor logs, may not be applicable to all environments. \nSecurity measures will be applied based on a risk-based approach and implemented where feasible. The specific controls \nimplemented will vary depending on the location and the nature of the activities being conducted there.\n\nMaintenance of Security Equipment: Any repairs or maintenance to physical security equipment, including locks, cameras, and access \ncontrol systems, must be documented, with records retained for at least seven years.\nCCTV Monitoring: Secure areas must be monitored by CCTV, with recordings stored for at least 3 months.

facilities, infrastructure, and sensitive data based on a risk-\nbased approach and implemented where feasible. \nAccess Restriction: Physical access to the company's secure facilities, such as server rooms and critical infrastructure, is restricted to \nauthorized personnel only. In remote locations, employees are responsible for securing access to company resources through digital \nmeans, such as VPNs and secure login systems.\nEmployee Identification: In secure controlled facilities, employees are required to wear identification badges to distinguish themselves \nas authorized personnel. In remote environments, this control may not be applicable but should be supplemented by other identity \nverification methods where necessary.\nVisitor Management: Visitors and vendors must be escorted by an authorized employee at all times while on company premises. Visitor \naccess may not be applicable in remote locations, but employees are required to ensure the confidentiality and security of any sensitive \ninformation.\nIncident Reporting: All workforce members are responsible for reporting unauthorized visitors or access attempts to company facilities \nor systems. This includes both physical locations and remote work environments. Reporting should be immediate to the Security Officer \nor Facility Manager.\nRecord-Keeping: It is recommended to retain a detailed record of each physical access, including visits, maintenance, and repairs \nwhere feasible.\nGiven the remote nature of many locations, physical controls will be implemented flexibly based on an assessment of the risks involved in \neach environment.\n3.2 Access Requirements\nPhysical access to secure facilities is managed through badge readers, smart locks, and physical keys. In environments where these \ncontrols are not applicable, such as coworking spaces, alternative security measures based on risk assessments will be applied.\nBadge and Key Management: Access to the company's badge and key systems is restricted to authorized personnel based on a need-\nto-know basis. Workforce members must report lost or stolen keys or badges immediately to their manager, and the Facility Manager \nmust re-provision access or change locks within 7 days.\nRestricted Areas: Secure areas, such as server rooms, must be locked when unattended, and access is granted only to authorized \nemployees. In remote or coworking environments, employees must ensure their devices and sensitive information are secured.\nVisitor Controls: Visitors must sign a log upon entering secure facilities, indicating the date, time, purpose, and point of contact. Visitor \nlogs must be kept for at least 3 months. In remote environments, visitor controls may not be applicable but should be replaced by strong \ndigital access controls.\nLoading and Delivery Areas: Access to loading and delivery areas is restricted to authorized personnel, and shipments should be \ninspected according to Asset Management procedures. In remote locations, this control may not be necessary but should be considered \nif the location handles sensitive assets.\n3.3 Maintenance and Monitoring\nContinuous monitoring and maintenance of physical security systems are crucial for protecting the company's assets. These requirements \napply primarily to formal company locations, while remote work environments may not require such stringent controls.\nMany of the company's operations take place either in its own offices or remotely, including at home, in cafes, or coworking spaces. \nThe company's own offices may also be considered as remote locations in certain contexts.\nAs a result, certain physical security controls, such as badge systems or visitor logs, may not be applicable to all environments. \nSecurity measures will be applied based on a risk-based approach and implemented where feasible. The specific controls \nimplemented will vary depending on the location and the nature of the activities being conducted there.\n\nMaintenance of Security Equipment: Any repairs or maintenance to physical security equipment, including locks, cameras, and access \ncontrol systems, must be documented, with records retained for at least seven years.\nCCTV Monitoring: Secure areas must be monitored by CCTV, with recordings stored for at least 3 months.

All \naccess is regulated using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), adhering to the Principle of Least Privilege to ensure that each user has \nonly the necessary access required to perform their duties.\nMinimum Necessary Access: User access to systems is determined by job classification, ensuring that only the minimum necessary \nlevel of access is granted.\nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC): The assignment of user rights and access to systems is regulated by the RBAC method, \nensuring that access levels align with user roles and responsibilities.\nSegregation of Duties: The need for segregation of duties is considered when assigning user rights, preventing potential conflicts of \ninterest or undue concentration of authority.\nFormal Documentation and Authorization: All access requests, including the addition, deletion, and modification of user IDs, \nauthentication factors, and other identifying objects, must be documented and formally authorized.\nAccess Request Process: Workforce members initiate access requests by creating an issue in the company's ticketing system, \ndetailing the type of access needed.\nIdentity Verification: User identities must be verified in person whenever possible before granting access to new accounts. For remote \nemployees, verification may be conducted over the phone, with the method of verification recorded in the ticketing system.\nAuthorization by Security Officer: The Security Officer is responsible for granting or rejecting access based on the employee's role \nand job classification. If additional access is required, the requester must provide a valid reason as part of the request.\nReview and Documentation: If an access request is rejected, it must go through a further review process, with detailed documentation. \nApproved requests are marked as complete and include all pertinent notes.\nAccess to the company's systems is carefully regulated through RBAC, ensuring that users are granted only the minimum necessary access \nfor their roles. Formal documentation and identity verification are required, with reviews conducted for additional access requests to \nmaintain security and accountability.\n3.2 Access Reviews\nUser access to company systems and services will be subject to periodic reviews to ensure that accounts, including third-party or vendor \naccounts, are appropriately assigned based on job functions. These reviews help maintain compliance with the Principle of Least Privilege \nand ensure access rights are adjusted as needed.\nQuarterly Access Reviews: Management will conduct formal access reviews at least once every quarter to verify that the roles and \npermissions associated with all user accounts, including third-party or vendor accounts, are still appropriate.\nJob Function Alignment: Access reviews focus on ensuring that user roles and permissions are aligned with current job functions and \nthat no excess or unauthorized access exists.\nManagement Authorization: During the access review, management is responsible for confirming that user accounts are in compliance \nwith established authorization requirements.\nQuarterly access reviews ensure that user accounts, including third-party and vendor accounts, remain aligned with job responsibilities, \npreventing unnecessary or unauthorized access to sensitive systems. These reviews are a key part of the company's efforts to maintain \nappropriate security controls.\n3.3 User Identification and Authentication\nTo ensure the security of system components, users and administrators must be authenticated using at least one authentication factor. This \nprocess is critical to safeguarding the company's systems and sensitive information.\nAuthentication Factors: Access will require at least one of the following:\nSomething you know, such as a password or passphrase.\n\nSomething you have, such as a token device or smart card.\nSomething you are, such as a biometric element.\nUnique Login Credentials: Each user will have a unique login ID and password, ensuring individual accountability.\nAuthentication Requirements: Single sign-on (SSO) and minimum password requirements will be enforced based on the company's \nPassword Policy. Passwords will never be displayed, transmitted, or stored in plain text.\nDefault Accounts: Default accounts on all production systems, including root, will be deleted, disabled, or restricted to a limited number \nof authorized administrators. These accounts will only be used under exceptional circumstances with documented business justification \nand management approval.\nShared Accounts: The use of group, shared, or generic accounts is prohibited unless absolutely necessary and approved by \nmanagement. Individual user identity must be confirmed before access is granted, and all actions must be traceable to a specific user.\nAuthentication Tokens: Physical or logical tokens, smart cards, or certificates will be assigned to individual users and cannot be \nshared. Additional controls, such as PINs or biometric data, will ensure only authorized users can access accounts.\nAutomated Log-on: Automated log-on configurations, other than the company's approved password management tools, are prohibited \nfrom storing user passwords or bypassing password entry on workstations or production systems.\nThe company enforces strict identification and authentication policies, requiring the use of unique credentials, secure authentication factors, \nand limiting access to default and shared accounts. These measures ensure accountability and safeguard access to critical systems.\n3.4 Multi-factor Authentication\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all system access where technically feasible, providing an additional layer of security for \nusers, administrators, and third parties.\nUse of MFA: MFA will be enforced to enhance security by requiring multiple types of authentication for access to systems.\nSystem Configuration: Systems using MFA must:\nPrevent replay attacks through secure token generation and validation processes.\nRequire at least two distinct types of authentication factors (e.g., something you know, something you have, or something you are).\nRestrict any bypassing of MFA by users, including administrative users, unless specifically documented and approved by \nmanagement on an exception basis, for a limited time period.\nRemote Access: MFA is mandatory for all remote access to the company's network, including access by users, administrators, and \nthird-party vendors. This ensures that remote connections are secure and access is only granted to authenticated users.\nMulti-factor authentication is essential to securing system access, particularly for remote access scenarios. By requiring multiple \nauthentication factors and preventing unauthorized bypassing, the company maintains a high level of security for all users and systems.\n3.5 Automated Logoffs\nAutomated logoffs are implemented to secure devices and systems by minimizing unauthorized access due to inactivity.\nScreen Lock Timeout: Company-issued devices and any bring-your-own or third-party devices connected to company systems will \nenforce a screensaver lock with a timeout of 15 minutes or less of inactivity. This ensures that devices are locked when not actively in \nuse, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\nSystem Logoff: Where technically feasible, the company's applications and systems will automatically log users out after 15 minutes of \ninactivity or upon closure of the system or internet browser. This configuration secures the system by terminating sessions that may \notherwise remain vulnerable to unauthorized access.\nAutomated logoffs are an important control for ensuring security, by locking or logging out inactive sessions on both devices and systems. \nThese measures protect sensitive data by ensuring that unattended devices and open sessions are quickly secured.\n\n3.6 Third-Party Access\nThird-party access to the company's systems is strictly controlled to ensure security and accountability when external entities access critical \nsystem components.\nTime-Limited Access: Accounts provided to third parties for system access, support, or maintenance will be enabled only for the \nrequired time period. Access will be granted based on documented approval from management and will be promptly disabled once the \nspecific task is completed.\nMonitoring of Remote Access: All third-party remote access will be continuously monitored by company personnel for any signs of \nunauthorized or unexpected activity. Monitoring will include real-time oversight and logging of access events to ensure accountability and \ndetect potential security risks.\nAuthorization and Documentation: All third-party access must be authorized by management, with clear documentation outlining the \npurpose, duration, and scope of access. No third-party access will be granted without proper authorization.\nThird-party access is restricted and closely monitored to ensure that external entities are granted system access only when necessary, with \nappropriate safeguards in place to detect and address any unauthorized activity.\n3.7 Application and System Accounts\nApplication and system accounts will be managed to ensure access is limited to only what is necessary for system operability and will follow \nstrict guidelines for security.\nProvisioning of Accounts: All application and system accounts will be provisioned based on documented authorization from \nmanagement. Access privileges will be limited to only what is necessary for the application or system to function effectively, \nminimizing unnecessary access.\nInteractive Login Management: \nPrevention of Interactive Use: Interactive login through system or application accounts will be prevented unless specifically \nrequired for an exceptional circumstance. \nTime-Limited Access: If interactive access is required, it will be restricted to the necessary timeframe to complete the required \ntask. \nBusiness Justification: A documented business justification must accompany any request for interactive login, explaining why \nsuch access is necessary.\nManagement Approval: Interactive use must be explicitly approved by management, ensuring that only authorized personnel can \nuse the account.\nAccountability: Every action taken using an interactive account must be attributable to an individual user. Individual user identity \nwill be confirmed before access is granted.\nApplication and system accounts will be tightly controlled to ensure that they are only used for necessary system operations, with interactive \naccess limited to exceptional circumstances and approved by management. Every action must be linked to an identifiable user to maintain \naccountability.\n3.8 Use of Utility Programs\nAccess to utility programs that have the potential to bypass normal operating system or application controls will be restricted to authorized \npersonnel to maintain the security and integrity of the company's systems.\nRestricted Access to Utility Programs: Only authorized system administrators will have access to manage utility programs such as \nanti-virus consoles, diagnostic tools, patching software, backup utilities, and network tools. These programs will be restricted from \ngeneral user access due to their ability to bypass normal security controls.\nPrivileged Utility Access Control: \nStandard User Restrictions: Standard users will be restricted from accessing privileged utilities or making modifications to their \nconfigurations.\n\nAuthentication and Access Controls: Strict authentication mechanisms and access controls will be implemented to ensure only \nauthorized administrators can access or modify utility programs, preventing unauthorized changes to the system.\nUtility programs with the ability to bypass security controls will be strictly restricted to authorized system administrators, with standard users \ndenied access. This ensures the integrity of system configurations and limits unauthorized access to privileged tools.\n3.9 Employee Termination/Offboarding Procedures\nThe company will revoke system and physical access for terminated users (employees, third parties, vendors, and other personnel) \npromptly to safeguard its systems and data.\nAccess Revocation: System and physical access will be revoked within one business day of the termination date. This applies to all \nterminated users including employees, vendors, and third parties.\nTermination Checklist and Notification:\nThe HR/People department, along with the users and their supervisors, are responsible for notifying system administrators of \nupcoming separations and ensuring the completion of a \"Termination Checklist.\"\nSystem administrators will terminate access rights within the established service level agreements (SLAs) upon notification of \ntermination or separation.\nAsset Return Tracking: \nThe HR/People department (or designated department) will track the return of all electronic and physical assets, including \nlaptops, files, access mechanisms (such as keys, access cards, badges, and multi-factor authentication tokens) as part of the \noffboarding process.\nIncident-Based Access Termination:\nSystem administrators will terminate a user's access if there is evidence or suspicion that:\nThe user has been misusing their access rights.\nA user's password has been compromised. If the user is not responsible for the password compromise, a new password may \nbe provided.\nUpon termination, the company ensures that access to systems and physical locations is revoked within one business day, while the \nHR/People department oversees asset returns and the completion of termination procedures. Access is also terminated if there is misuse or \nevidence of a password compromise.\n3.10 Disabling Accounts: High-Risk Users\nThe company will disable accounts of users deemed to pose a high risk to its systems and data. Accounts will be disabled for a specified \nperiod depending on the risk severity.\nUser intends to sell company information to a competitor Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser accesses unauthorized sensitive data without a business \nneed \nImmediately                 3 weeks                     \nUser deliberately attempts to bypass security controls Immediately                 6 weeks                     \nUser leaks confidential information to external parties Immediately                 2 months                    \nUser violates policy by sharing credentials Immediately                 2 weeks                     \nUser installs unauthorized software or malware Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser repeatedly fails to comply with security procedures Immediately                 4 weeks                     \nUser uses company resources for illegal activities Immediately                 Permanent Disablement       \nRiskTime Period to DisableDuration of Disablement\n\nHigh-risk accounts will be disabled promptly based on the nature of the risk and the severity of the violation.

These reviews are a key part of the company's efforts to maintain \nappropriate security controls.\n3.3 User Identification and Authentication\nTo ensure the security of system components, users and administrators must be authenticated using at least one authentication factor. This \nprocess is critical to safeguarding the company's systems and sensitive information.\nAuthentication Factors: Access will require at least one of the following:\nSomething you know, such as a password or passphrase.\n\nSomething you have, such as a token device or smart card.\nSomething you are, such as a biometric element.\nUnique Login Credentials: Each user will have a unique login ID and password, ensuring individual accountability.\nAuthentication Requirements: Single sign-on (SSO) and minimum password requirements will be enforced based on the company's \nPassword Policy. Passwords will never be displayed, transmitted, or stored in plain text.\nDefault Accounts: Default accounts on all production systems, including root, will be deleted, disabled, or restricted to a limited number \nof authorized administrators. These accounts will only be used under exceptional circumstances with documented business justification \nand management approval.\nShared Accounts: The use of group, shared, or generic accounts is prohibited unless absolutely necessary and approved by \nmanagement. Individual user identity must be confirmed before access is granted, and all actions must be traceable to a specific user.\nAuthentication Tokens: Physical or logical tokens, smart cards, or certificates will be assigned to individual users and cannot be \nshared. Additional controls, such as PINs or biometric data, will ensure only authorized users can access accounts.\nAutomated Log-on: Automated log-on configurations, other than the company's approved password management tools, are prohibited \nfrom storing user passwords or bypassing password entry on workstations or production systems.\nThe company enforces strict identification and authentication policies, requiring the use of unique credentials, secure authentication factors, \nand limiting access to default and shared accounts. These measures ensure accountability and safeguard access to critical systems.\n3.4 Multi-factor Authentication\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all system access where technically feasible, providing an additional layer of security for \nusers, administrators, and third parties.\nUse of MFA: MFA will be enforced to enhance security by requiring multiple types of authentication for access to systems.\nSystem Configuration: Systems using MFA must:\nPrevent replay attacks through secure token generation and validation processes.\nRequire at least two distinct types of authentication factors (e.g., something you know, something you have, or something you are).\nRestrict any bypassing of MFA by users, including administrative users, unless specifically documented and approved by \nmanagement on an exception basis, for a limited time period.\nRemote Access: MFA is mandatory for all remote access to the company's network, including access by users, administrators, and \nthird-party vendors. This ensures that remote connections are secure and access is only granted to authenticated users.\nMulti-factor authentication is essential to securing system access, particularly for remote access scenarios. By requiring multiple \nauthentication factors and preventing unauthorized bypassing, the company maintains a high level of security for all users and systems.\n3.5 Automated Logoffs\nAutomated logoffs are implemented to secure devices and systems by minimizing unauthorized access due to inactivity.\nScreen Lock Timeout: Company-issued devices and any bring-your-own or third-party devices connected to company systems will \nenforce a screensaver lock with a timeout of 15 minutes or less of inactivity. This ensures that devices are locked when not actively in \nuse, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\nSystem Logoff: Where technically feasible, the company's applications and systems will automatically log users out after 15 minutes of \ninactivity or upon closure of the system or internet browser. This configuration secures the system by terminating sessions that may \notherwise remain vulnerable to unauthorized access.\nAutomated logoffs are an important control for ensuring security, by locking or logging out inactive sessions on both devices and systems. \nThese measures protect sensitive data by ensuring that unattended devices and open sessions are quickly secured.\n\n3.6 Third-Party Access\nThird-party access to the company's systems is strictly controlled to ensure security and accountability when external entities access critical \nsystem components.\nTime-Limited Access: Accounts provided to third parties for system access, support, or maintenance will be enabled only for the \nrequired time period. Access will be granted based on documented approval from management and will be promptly disabled once the \nspecific task is completed.\nMonitoring of Remote Access: All third-party remote access will be continuously monitored by company personnel for any signs of \nunauthorized or unexpected activity. Monitoring will include real-time oversight and logging of access events to ensure accountability and \ndetect potential security risks.\nAuthorization and Documentation: All third-party access must be authorized by management, with clear documentation outlining the \npurpose, duration, and scope of access. No third-party access will be granted without proper authorization.\nThird-party access is restricted and closely monitored to ensure that external entities are granted system access only when necessary, with \nappropriate safeguards in place to detect and address any unauthorized activity.\n3.7 Application and System Accounts\nApplication and system accounts will be managed to ensure access is limited to only what is necessary for system operability and will follow \nstrict guidelines for security.\nProvisioning of Accounts: All application and system accounts will be provisioned based on documented authorization from \nmanagement. Access privileges will be limited to only what is necessary for the application or system to function effectively, \nminimizing unnecessary access.\nInteractive Login Management: \nPrevention of Interactive Use: Interactive login through system or application accounts will be prevented unless specifically \nrequired for an exceptional circumstance. \nTime-Limited Access: If interactive access is required, it will be restricted to the necessary timeframe to complete the required \ntask. \nBusiness Justification: A documented business justification must accompany any request for interactive login, explaining why \nsuch access is necessary.\nManagement Approval: Interactive use must be explicitly approved by management, ensuring that only authorized personnel can \nuse the account.\nAccountability: Every action taken using an interactive account must be attributable to an individual user. Individual user identity \nwill be confirmed before access is granted.\nApplication and system accounts will be tightly controlled to ensure that they are only used for necessary system operations, with interactive \naccess limited to exceptional circumstances and approved by management. Every action must be linked to an identifiable user to maintain \naccountability.\n3.8 Use of Utility Programs\nAccess to utility programs that have the potential to bypass normal operating system or application controls will be restricted to authorized \npersonnel to maintain the security and integrity of the company's systems.\nRestricted Access to Utility Programs: Only authorized system administrators will have access to manage utility programs such as \nanti-virus consoles, diagnostic tools, patching software, backup utilities, and network tools. These programs will be restricted from \ngeneral user access due to their ability to bypass normal security controls.\nPrivileged Utility Access Control: \nStandard User Restrictions: Standard users will be restricted from accessing privileged utilities or making modifications to their \nconfigurations.\n\nAuthentication and Access Controls: Strict authentication mechanisms and access controls will be implemented to ensure only \nauthorized administrators can access or modify utility programs, preventing unauthorized changes to the system.\nUtility programs with the ability to bypass security controls will be strictly restricted to authorized system administrators, with standard users \ndenied access. This ensures the integrity of system configurations and limits unauthorized access to privileged tools.\n3.9 Employee Termination/Offboarding Procedures\nThe company will revoke system and physical access for terminated users (employees, third parties, vendors, and other personnel) \npromptly to safeguard its systems and data.\nAccess Revocation: System and physical access will be revoked within one business day of the termination date. This applies to all \nterminated users including employees, vendors, and third parties.\nTermination Checklist and Notification:\nThe HR/People department, along with the users and their supervisors, are responsible for notifying system administrators of \nupcoming separations and ensuring the completion of a \"Termination Checklist.\"\nSystem administrators will terminate access rights within the established service level agreements (SLAs) upon notification of \ntermination or separation.\nAsset Return Tracking: \nThe HR/People department (or designated department) will track the return of all electronic and physical assets, including \nlaptops, files, access mechanisms (such as keys, access cards, badges, and multi-factor authentication tokens) as part of the \noffboarding process.\nIncident-Based Access Termination:\nSystem administrators will terminate a user's access if there is evidence or suspicion that:\nThe user has been misusing their access rights.\nA user's password has been compromised. If the user is not responsible for the password compromise, a new password may \nbe provided.\nUpon termination, the company ensures that access to systems and physical locations is revoked within one business day, while the \nHR/People department oversees asset returns and the completion of termination procedures. Access is also terminated if there is misuse or \nevidence of a password compromise.\n3.10 Disabling Accounts: High-Risk Users\nThe company will disable accounts of users deemed to pose a high risk to its systems and data. Accounts will be disabled for a specified \nperiod depending on the risk severity.\nUser intends to sell company information to a competitor Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser accesses unauthorized sensitive data without a business \nneed \nImmediately                 3 weeks                     \nUser deliberately attempts to bypass security controls Immediately                 6 weeks                     \nUser leaks confidential information to external parties Immediately                 2 months                    \nUser violates policy by sharing credentials Immediately                 2 weeks                     \nUser installs unauthorized software or malware Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser repeatedly fails to comply with security procedures Immediately                 4 weeks                     \nUser uses company resources for illegal activities Immediately                 Permanent Disablement       \nRiskTime Period to DisableDuration of Disablement\n\nHigh-risk accounts will be disabled promptly based on the nature of the risk and the severity of the violation.

All \naccess is regulated using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), adhering to the Principle of Least Privilege to ensure that each user has \nonly the necessary access required to perform their duties.\nMinimum Necessary Access: User access to systems is determined by job classification, ensuring that only the minimum necessary \nlevel of access is granted.\nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC): The assignment of user rights and access to systems is regulated by the RBAC method, \nensuring that access levels align with user roles and responsibilities.\nSegregation of Duties: The need for segregation of duties is considered when assigning user rights, preventing potential conflicts of \ninterest or undue concentration of authority.\nFormal Documentation and Authorization: All access requests, including the addition, deletion, and modification of user IDs, \nauthentication factors, and other identifying objects, must be documented and formally authorized.\nAccess Request Process: Workforce members initiate access requests by creating an issue in the company's ticketing system, \ndetailing the type of access needed.\nIdentity Verification: User identities must be verified in person whenever possible before granting access to new accounts. For remote \nemployees, verification may be conducted over the phone, with the method of verification recorded in the ticketing system.\nAuthorization by Security Officer: The Security Officer is responsible for granting or rejecting access based on the employee's role \nand job classification. If additional access is required, the requester must provide a valid reason as part of the request.\nReview and Documentation: If an access request is rejected, it must go through a further review process, with detailed documentation. \nApproved requests are marked as complete and include all pertinent notes.\nAccess to the company's systems is carefully regulated through RBAC, ensuring that users are granted only the minimum necessary access \nfor their roles. Formal documentation and identity verification are required, with reviews conducted for additional access requests to \nmaintain security and accountability.\n3.2 Access Reviews\nUser access to company systems and services will be subject to periodic reviews to ensure that accounts, including third-party or vendor \naccounts, are appropriately assigned based on job functions. These reviews help maintain compliance with the Principle of Least Privilege \nand ensure access rights are adjusted as needed.\nQuarterly Access Reviews: Management will conduct formal access reviews at least once every quarter to verify that the roles and \npermissions associated with all user accounts, including third-party or vendor accounts, are still appropriate.\nJob Function Alignment: Access reviews focus on ensuring that user roles and permissions are aligned with current job functions and \nthat no excess or unauthorized access exists.\nManagement Authorization: During the access review, management is responsible for confirming that user accounts are in compliance \nwith established authorization requirements.\nQuarterly access reviews ensure that user accounts, including third-party and vendor accounts, remain aligned with job responsibilities, \npreventing unnecessary or unauthorized access to sensitive systems. These reviews are a key part of the company's efforts to maintain \nappropriate security controls.\n3.3 User Identification and Authentication\nTo ensure the security of system components, users and administrators must be authenticated using at least one authentication factor. This \nprocess is critical to safeguarding the company's systems and sensitive information.\nAuthentication Factors: Access will require at least one of the following:\nSomething you know, such as a password or passphrase.\n\nSomething you have, such as a token device or smart card.\nSomething you are, such as a biometric element.\nUnique Login Credentials: Each user will have a unique login ID and password, ensuring individual accountability.\nAuthentication Requirements: Single sign-on (SSO) and minimum password requirements will be enforced based on the company's \nPassword Policy. Passwords will never be displayed, transmitted, or stored in plain text.\nDefault Accounts: Default accounts on all production systems, including root, will be deleted, disabled, or restricted to a limited number \nof authorized administrators. These accounts will only be used under exceptional circumstances with documented business justification \nand management approval.\nShared Accounts: The use of group, shared, or generic accounts is prohibited unless absolutely necessary and approved by \nmanagement. Individual user identity must be confirmed before access is granted, and all actions must be traceable to a specific user.\nAuthentication Tokens: Physical or logical tokens, smart cards, or certificates will be assigned to individual users and cannot be \nshared. Additional controls, such as PINs or biometric data, will ensure only authorized users can access accounts.\nAutomated Log-on: Automated log-on configurations, other than the company's approved password management tools, are prohibited \nfrom storing user passwords or bypassing password entry on workstations or production systems.\nThe company enforces strict identification and authentication policies, requiring the use of unique credentials, secure authentication factors, \nand limiting access to default and shared accounts. These measures ensure accountability and safeguard access to critical systems.\n3.4 Multi-factor Authentication\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all system access where technically feasible, providing an additional layer of security for \nusers, administrators, and third parties.\nUse of MFA: MFA will be enforced to enhance security by requiring multiple types of authentication for access to systems.\nSystem Configuration: Systems using MFA must:\nPrevent replay attacks through secure token generation and validation processes.\nRequire at least two distinct types of authentication factors (e.g., something you know, something you have, or something you are).\nRestrict any bypassing of MFA by users, including administrative users, unless specifically documented and approved by \nmanagement on an exception basis, for a limited time period.\nRemote Access: MFA is mandatory for all remote access to the company's network, including access by users, administrators, and \nthird-party vendors. This ensures that remote connections are secure and access is only granted to authenticated users.\nMulti-factor authentication is essential to securing system access, particularly for remote access scenarios. By requiring multiple \nauthentication factors and preventing unauthorized bypassing, the company maintains a high level of security for all users and systems.\n3.5 Automated Logoffs\nAutomated logoffs are implemented to secure devices and systems by minimizing unauthorized access due to inactivity.\nScreen Lock Timeout: Company-issued devices and any bring-your-own or third-party devices connected to company systems will \nenforce a screensaver lock with a timeout of 15 minutes or less of inactivity. This ensures that devices are locked when not actively in \nuse, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\nSystem Logoff: Where technically feasible, the company's applications and systems will automatically log users out after 15 minutes of \ninactivity or upon closure of the system or internet browser. This configuration secures the system by terminating sessions that may \notherwise remain vulnerable to unauthorized access.\nAutomated logoffs are an important control for ensuring security, by locking or logging out inactive sessions on both devices and systems. \nThese measures protect sensitive data by ensuring that unattended devices and open sessions are quickly secured.\n\n3.6 Third-Party Access\nThird-party access to the company's systems is strictly controlled to ensure security and accountability when external entities access critical \nsystem components.\nTime-Limited Access: Accounts provided to third parties for system access, support, or maintenance will be enabled only for the \nrequired time period. Access will be granted based on documented approval from management and will be promptly disabled once the \nspecific task is completed.\nMonitoring of Remote Access: All third-party remote access will be continuously monitored by company personnel for any signs of \nunauthorized or unexpected activity. Monitoring will include real-time oversight and logging of access events to ensure accountability and \ndetect potential security risks.\nAuthorization and Documentation: All third-party access must be authorized by management, with clear documentation outlining the \npurpose, duration, and scope of access. No third-party access will be granted without proper authorization.\nThird-party access is restricted and closely monitored to ensure that external entities are granted system access only when necessary, with \nappropriate safeguards in place to detect and address any unauthorized activity.\n3.7 Application and System Accounts\nApplication and system accounts will be managed to ensure access is limited to only what is necessary for system operability and will follow \nstrict guidelines for security.\nProvisioning of Accounts: All application and system accounts will be provisioned based on documented authorization from \nmanagement. Access privileges will be limited to only what is necessary for the application or system to function effectively, \nminimizing unnecessary access.\nInteractive Login Management: \nPrevention of Interactive Use: Interactive login through system or application accounts will be prevented unless specifically \nrequired for an exceptional circumstance. \nTime-Limited Access: If interactive access is required, it will be restricted to the necessary timeframe to complete the required \ntask. \nBusiness Justification: A documented business justification must accompany any request for interactive login, explaining why \nsuch access is necessary.\nManagement Approval: Interactive use must be explicitly approved by management, ensuring that only authorized personnel can \nuse the account.\nAccountability: Every action taken using an interactive account must be attributable to an individual user. Individual user identity \nwill be confirmed before access is granted.\nApplication and system accounts will be tightly controlled to ensure that they are only used for necessary system operations, with interactive \naccess limited to exceptional circumstances and approved by management. Every action must be linked to an identifiable user to maintain \naccountability.\n3.8 Use of Utility Programs\nAccess to utility programs that have the potential to bypass normal operating system or application controls will be restricted to authorized \npersonnel to maintain the security and integrity of the company's systems.\nRestricted Access to Utility Programs: Only authorized system administrators will have access to manage utility programs such as \nanti-virus consoles, diagnostic tools, patching software, backup utilities, and network tools. These programs will be restricted from \ngeneral user access due to their ability to bypass normal security controls.\nPrivileged Utility Access Control: \nStandard User Restrictions: Standard users will be restricted from accessing privileged utilities or making modifications to their \nconfigurations.\n\nAuthentication and Access Controls: Strict authentication mechanisms and access controls will be implemented to ensure only \nauthorized administrators can access or modify utility programs, preventing unauthorized changes to the system.\nUtility programs with the ability to bypass security controls will be strictly restricted to authorized system administrators, with standard users \ndenied access. This ensures the integrity of system configurations and limits unauthorized access to privileged tools.\n3.9 Employee Termination/Offboarding Procedures\nThe company will revoke system and physical access for terminated users (employees, third parties, vendors, and other personnel) \npromptly to safeguard its systems and data.\nAccess Revocation: System and physical access will be revoked within one business day of the termination date. This applies to all \nterminated users including employees, vendors, and third parties.\nTermination Checklist and Notification:\nThe HR/People department, along with the users and their supervisors, are responsible for notifying system administrators of \nupcoming separations and ensuring the completion of a \"Termination Checklist.\"\nSystem administrators will terminate access rights within the established service level agreements (SLAs) upon notification of \ntermination or separation.\nAsset Return Tracking: \nThe HR/People department (or designated department) will track the return of all electronic and physical assets, including \nlaptops, files, access mechanisms (such as keys, access cards, badges, and multi-factor authentication tokens) as part of the \noffboarding process.\nIncident-Based Access Termination:\nSystem administrators will terminate a user's access if there is evidence or suspicion that:\nThe user has been misusing their access rights.\nA user's password has been compromised. If the user is not responsible for the password compromise, a new password may \nbe provided.\nUpon termination, the company ensures that access to systems and physical locations is revoked within one business day, while the \nHR/People department oversees asset returns and the completion of termination procedures. Access is also terminated if there is misuse or \nevidence of a password compromise.\n3.10 Disabling Accounts: High-Risk Users\nThe company will disable accounts of users deemed to pose a high risk to its systems and data. Accounts will be disabled for a specified \nperiod depending on the risk severity.\nUser intends to sell company information to a competitor Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser accesses unauthorized sensitive data without a business \nneed \nImmediately                 3 weeks                     \nUser deliberately attempts to bypass security controls Immediately                 6 weeks                     \nUser leaks confidential information to external parties Immediately                 2 months                    \nUser violates policy by sharing credentials Immediately                 2 weeks                     \nUser installs unauthorized software or malware Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser repeatedly fails to comply with security procedures Immediately                 4 weeks                     \nUser uses company resources for illegal activities Immediately                 Permanent Disablement       \nRiskTime Period to DisableDuration of Disablement\n\nHigh-risk accounts will be disabled promptly based on the nature of the risk and the severity of the violation.

All \naccess is regulated using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), adhering to the Principle of Least Privilege to ensure that each user has \nonly the necessary access required to perform their duties.\nMinimum Necessary Access: User access to systems is determined by job classification, ensuring that only the minimum necessary \nlevel of access is granted.\nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC): The assignment of user rights and access to systems is regulated by the RBAC method, \nensuring that access levels align with user roles and responsibilities.\nSegregation of Duties: The need for segregation of duties is considered when assigning user rights, preventing potential conflicts of \ninterest or undue concentration of authority.\nFormal Documentation and Authorization: All access requests, including the addition, deletion, and modification of user IDs, \nauthentication factors, and other identifying objects, must be documented and formally authorized.\nAccess Request Process: Workforce members initiate access requests by creating an issue in the company's ticketing system, \ndetailing the type of access needed.\nIdentity Verification: User identities must be verified in person whenever possible before granting access to new accounts. For remote \nemployees, verification may be conducted over the phone, with the method of verification recorded in the ticketing system.\nAuthorization by Security Officer: The Security Officer is responsible for granting or rejecting access based on the employee's role \nand job classification. If additional access is required, the requester must provide a valid reason as part of the request.\nReview and Documentation: If an access request is rejected, it must go through a further review process, with detailed documentation. \nApproved requests are marked as complete and include all pertinent notes.\nAccess to the company's systems is carefully regulated through RBAC, ensuring that users are granted only the minimum necessary access \nfor their roles. Formal documentation and identity verification are required, with reviews conducted for additional access requests to \nmaintain security and accountability.\n3.2 Access Reviews\nUser access to company systems and services will be subject to periodic reviews to ensure that accounts, including third-party or vendor \naccounts, are appropriately assigned based on job functions. These reviews help maintain compliance with the Principle of Least Privilege \nand ensure access rights are adjusted as needed.\nQuarterly Access Reviews: Management will conduct formal access reviews at least once every quarter to verify that the roles and \npermissions associated with all user accounts, including third-party or vendor accounts, are still appropriate.\nJob Function Alignment: Access reviews focus on ensuring that user roles and permissions are aligned with current job functions and \nthat no excess or unauthorized access exists.\nManagement Authorization: During the access review, management is responsible for confirming that user accounts are in compliance \nwith established authorization requirements.\nQuarterly access reviews ensure that user accounts, including third-party and vendor accounts, remain aligned with job responsibilities, \npreventing unnecessary or unauthorized access to sensitive systems. These reviews are a key part of the company's efforts to maintain \nappropriate security controls.\n3.3 User Identification and Authentication\nTo ensure the security of system components, users and administrators must be authenticated using at least one authentication factor. This \nprocess is critical to safeguarding the company's systems and sensitive information.\nAuthentication Factors: Access will require at least one of the following:\nSomething you know, such as a password or passphrase.\n\nSomething you have, such as a token device or smart card.\nSomething you are, such as a biometric element.\nUnique Login Credentials: Each user will have a unique login ID and password, ensuring individual accountability.\nAuthentication Requirements: Single sign-on (SSO) and minimum password requirements will be enforced based on the company's \nPassword Policy. Passwords will never be displayed, transmitted, or stored in plain text.\nDefault Accounts: Default accounts on all production systems, including root, will be deleted, disabled, or restricted to a limited number \nof authorized administrators. These accounts will only be used under exceptional circumstances with documented business justification \nand management approval.\nShared Accounts: The use of group, shared, or generic accounts is prohibited unless absolutely necessary and approved by \nmanagement. Individual user identity must be confirmed before access is granted, and all actions must be traceable to a specific user.\nAuthentication Tokens: Physical or logical tokens, smart cards, or certificates will be assigned to individual users and cannot be \nshared. Additional controls, such as PINs or biometric data, will ensure only authorized users can access accounts.\nAutomated Log-on: Automated log-on configurations, other than the company's approved password management tools, are prohibited \nfrom storing user passwords or bypassing password entry on workstations or production systems.\nThe company enforces strict identification and authentication policies, requiring the use of unique credentials, secure authentication factors, \nand limiting access to default and shared accounts. These measures ensure accountability and safeguard access to critical systems.\n3.4 Multi-factor Authentication\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all system access where technically feasible, providing an additional layer of security for \nusers, administrators, and third parties.\nUse of MFA: MFA will be enforced to enhance security by requiring multiple types of authentication for access to systems.\nSystem Configuration: Systems using MFA must:\nPrevent replay attacks through secure token generation and validation processes.\nRequire at least two distinct types of authentication factors (e.g., something you know, something you have, or something you are).\nRestrict any bypassing of MFA by users, including administrative users, unless specifically documented and approved by \nmanagement on an exception basis, for a limited time period.\nRemote Access: MFA is mandatory for all remote access to the company's network, including access by users, administrators, and \nthird-party vendors. This ensures that remote connections are secure and access is only granted to authenticated users.\nMulti-factor authentication is essential to securing system access, particularly for remote access scenarios. By requiring multiple \nauthentication factors and preventing unauthorized bypassing, the company maintains a high level of security for all users and systems.\n3.5 Automated Logoffs\nAutomated logoffs are implemented to secure devices and systems by minimizing unauthorized access due to inactivity.\nScreen Lock Timeout: Company-issued devices and any bring-your-own or third-party devices connected to company systems will \nenforce a screensaver lock with a timeout of 15 minutes or less of inactivity. This ensures that devices are locked when not actively in \nuse, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\nSystem Logoff: Where technically feasible, the company's applications and systems will automatically log users out after 15 minutes of \ninactivity or upon closure of the system or internet browser. This configuration secures the system by terminating sessions that may \notherwise remain vulnerable to unauthorized access.\nAutomated logoffs are an important control for ensuring security, by locking or logging out inactive sessions on both devices and systems. \nThese measures protect sensitive data by ensuring that unattended devices and open sessions are quickly secured.\n\n3.6 Third-Party Access\nThird-party access to the company's systems is strictly controlled to ensure security and accountability when external entities access critical \nsystem components.\nTime-Limited Access: Accounts provided to third parties for system access, support, or maintenance will be enabled only for the \nrequired time period. Access will be granted based on documented approval from management and will be promptly disabled once the \nspecific task is completed.\nMonitoring of Remote Access: All third-party remote access will be continuously monitored by company personnel for any signs of \nunauthorized or unexpected activity. Monitoring will include real-time oversight and logging of access events to ensure accountability and \ndetect potential security risks.\nAuthorization and Documentation: All third-party access must be authorized by management, with clear documentation outlining the \npurpose, duration, and scope of access. No third-party access will be granted without proper authorization.\nThird-party access is restricted and closely monitored to ensure that external entities are granted system access only when necessary, with \nappropriate safeguards in place to detect and address any unauthorized activity.\n3.7 Application and System Accounts\nApplication and system accounts will be managed to ensure access is limited to only what is necessary for system operability and will follow \nstrict guidelines for security.\nProvisioning of Accounts: All application and system accounts will be provisioned based on documented authorization from \nmanagement. Access privileges will be limited to only what is necessary for the application or system to function effectively, \nminimizing unnecessary access.\nInteractive Login Management: \nPrevention of Interactive Use: Interactive login through system or application accounts will be prevented unless specifically \nrequired for an exceptional circumstance. \nTime-Limited Access: If interactive access is required, it will be restricted to the necessary timeframe to complete the required \ntask. \nBusiness Justification: A documented business justification must accompany any request for interactive login, explaining why \nsuch access is necessary.\nManagement Approval: Interactive use must be explicitly approved by management, ensuring that only authorized personnel can \nuse the account.\nAccountability: Every action taken using an interactive account must be attributable to an individual user. Individual user identity \nwill be confirmed before access is granted.\nApplication and system accounts will be tightly controlled to ensure that they are only used for necessary system operations, with interactive \naccess limited to exceptional circumstances and approved by management. Every action must be linked to an identifiable user to maintain \naccountability.\n3.8 Use of Utility Programs\nAccess to utility programs that have the potential to bypass normal operating system or application controls will be restricted to authorized \npersonnel to maintain the security and integrity of the company's systems.\nRestricted Access to Utility Programs: Only authorized system administrators will have access to manage utility programs such as \nanti-virus consoles, diagnostic tools, patching software, backup utilities, and network tools. These programs will be restricted from \ngeneral user access due to their ability to bypass normal security controls.\nPrivileged Utility Access Control: \nStandard User Restrictions: Standard users will be restricted from accessing privileged utilities or making modifications to their \nconfigurations.\n\nAuthentication and Access Controls: Strict authentication mechanisms and access controls will be implemented to ensure only \nauthorized administrators can access or modify utility programs, preventing unauthorized changes to the system.\nUtility programs with the ability to bypass security controls will be strictly restricted to authorized system administrators, with standard users \ndenied access. This ensures the integrity of system configurations and limits unauthorized access to privileged tools.\n3.9 Employee Termination/Offboarding Procedures\nThe company will revoke system and physical access for terminated users (employees, third parties, vendors, and other personnel) \npromptly to safeguard its systems and data.\nAccess Revocation: System and physical access will be revoked within one business day of the termination date. This applies to all \nterminated users including employees, vendors, and third parties.\nTermination Checklist and Notification:\nThe HR/People department, along with the users and their supervisors, are responsible for notifying system administrators of \nupcoming separations and ensuring the completion of a \"Termination Checklist.\"\nSystem administrators will terminate access rights within the established service level agreements (SLAs) upon notification of \ntermination or separation.\nAsset Return Tracking: \nThe HR/People department (or designated department) will track the return of all electronic and physical assets, including \nlaptops, files, access mechanisms (such as keys, access cards, badges, and multi-factor authentication tokens) as part of the \noffboarding process.\nIncident-Based Access Termination:\nSystem administrators will terminate a user's access if there is evidence or suspicion that:\nThe user has been misusing their access rights.\nA user's password has been compromised. If the user is not responsible for the password compromise, a new password may \nbe provided.\nUpon termination, the company ensures that access to systems and physical locations is revoked within one business day, while the \nHR/People department oversees asset returns and the completion of termination procedures. Access is also terminated if there is misuse or \nevidence of a password compromise.\n3.10 Disabling Accounts: High-Risk Users\nThe company will disable accounts of users deemed to pose a high risk to its systems and data. Accounts will be disabled for a specified \nperiod depending on the risk severity.\nUser intends to sell company information to a competitor Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser accesses unauthorized sensitive data without a business \nneed \nImmediately                 3 weeks                     \nUser deliberately attempts to bypass security controls Immediately                 6 weeks                     \nUser leaks confidential information to external parties Immediately                 2 months                    \nUser violates policy by sharing credentials Immediately                 2 weeks                     \nUser installs unauthorized software or malware Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser repeatedly fails to comply with security procedures Immediately                 4 weeks                     \nUser uses company resources for illegal activities Immediately                 Permanent Disablement       \nRiskTime Period to DisableDuration of Disablement\n\nHigh-risk accounts will be disabled promptly based on the nature of the risk and the severity of the violation.

These reviews help maintain compliance with the Principle of Least Privilege \nand ensure access rights are adjusted as needed.\nQuarterly Access Reviews: Management will conduct formal access reviews at least once every quarter to verify that the roles and \npermissions associated with all user accounts, including third-party or vendor accounts, are still appropriate.\nJob Function Alignment: Access reviews focus on ensuring that user roles and permissions are aligned with current job functions and \nthat no excess or unauthorized access exists.\nManagement Authorization: During the access review, management is responsible for confirming that user accounts are in compliance \nwith established authorization requirements.\nQuarterly access reviews ensure that user accounts, including third-party and vendor accounts, remain aligned with job responsibilities, \npreventing unnecessary or unauthorized access to sensitive systems. These reviews are a key part of the company's efforts to maintain \nappropriate security controls.\n3.3 User Identification and Authentication\nTo ensure the security of system components, users and administrators must be authenticated using at least one authentication factor. This \nprocess is critical to safeguarding the company's systems and sensitive information.\nAuthentication Factors: Access will require at least one of the following:\nSomething you know, such as a password or passphrase.\n\nSomething you have, such as a token device or smart card.\nSomething you are, such as a biometric element.\nUnique Login Credentials: Each user will have a unique login ID and password, ensuring individual accountability.\nAuthentication Requirements: Single sign-on (SSO) and minimum password requirements will be enforced based on the company's \nPassword Policy. Passwords will never be displayed, transmitted, or stored in plain text.\nDefault Accounts: Default accounts on all production systems, including root, will be deleted, disabled, or restricted to a limited number \nof authorized administrators. These accounts will only be used under exceptional circumstances with documented business justification \nand management approval.\nShared Accounts: The use of group, shared, or generic accounts is prohibited unless absolutely necessary and approved by \nmanagement. Individual user identity must be confirmed before access is granted, and all actions must be traceable to a specific user.\nAuthentication Tokens: Physical or logical tokens, smart cards, or certificates will be assigned to individual users and cannot be \nshared. Additional controls, such as PINs or biometric data, will ensure only authorized users can access accounts.\nAutomated Log-on: Automated log-on configurations, other than the company's approved password management tools, are prohibited \nfrom storing user passwords or bypassing password entry on workstations or production systems.\nThe company enforces strict identification and authentication policies, requiring the use of unique credentials, secure authentication factors, \nand limiting access to default and shared accounts. These measures ensure accountability and safeguard access to critical systems.\n3.4 Multi-factor Authentication\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all system access where technically feasible, providing an additional layer of security for \nusers, administrators, and third parties.\nUse of MFA: MFA will be enforced to enhance security by requiring multiple types of authentication for access to systems.\nSystem Configuration: Systems using MFA must:\nPrevent replay attacks through secure token generation and validation processes.\nRequire at least two distinct types of authentication factors (e.g., something you know, something you have, or something you are).\nRestrict any bypassing of MFA by users, including administrative users, unless specifically documented and approved by \nmanagement on an exception basis, for a limited time period.\nRemote Access: MFA is mandatory for all remote access to the company's network, including access by users, administrators, and \nthird-party vendors. This ensures that remote connections are secure and access is only granted to authenticated users.\nMulti-factor authentication is essential to securing system access, particularly for remote access scenarios. By requiring multiple \nauthentication factors and preventing unauthorized bypassing, the company maintains a high level of security for all users and systems.\n3.5 Automated Logoffs\nAutomated logoffs are implemented to secure devices and systems by minimizing unauthorized access due to inactivity.\nScreen Lock Timeout: Company-issued devices and any bring-your-own or third-party devices connected to company systems will \nenforce a screensaver lock with a timeout of 15 minutes or less of inactivity. This ensures that devices are locked when not actively in \nuse, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\nSystem Logoff: Where technically feasible, the company's applications and systems will automatically log users out after 15 minutes of \ninactivity or upon closure of the system or internet browser. This configuration secures the system by terminating sessions that may \notherwise remain vulnerable to unauthorized access.\nAutomated logoffs are an important control for ensuring security, by locking or logging out inactive sessions on both devices and systems. \nThese measures protect sensitive data by ensuring that unattended devices and open sessions are quickly secured.\n\n3.6 Third-Party Access\nThird-party access to the company's systems is strictly controlled to ensure security and accountability when external entities access critical \nsystem components.\nTime-Limited Access: Accounts provided to third parties for system access, support, or maintenance will be enabled only for the \nrequired time period. Access will be granted based on documented approval from management and will be promptly disabled once the \nspecific task is completed.\nMonitoring of Remote Access: All third-party remote access will be continuously monitored by company personnel for any signs of \nunauthorized or unexpected activity. Monitoring will include real-time oversight and logging of access events to ensure accountability and \ndetect potential security risks.\nAuthorization and Documentation: All third-party access must be authorized by management, with clear documentation outlining the \npurpose, duration, and scope of access. No third-party access will be granted without proper authorization.\nThird-party access is restricted and closely monitored to ensure that external entities are granted system access only when necessary, with \nappropriate safeguards in place to detect and address any unauthorized activity.\n3.7 Application and System Accounts\nApplication and system accounts will be managed to ensure access is limited to only what is necessary for system operability and will follow \nstrict guidelines for security.\nProvisioning of Accounts: All application and system accounts will be provisioned based on documented authorization from \nmanagement. Access privileges will be limited to only what is necessary for the application or system to function effectively, \nminimizing unnecessary access.\nInteractive Login Management: \nPrevention of Interactive Use: Interactive login through system or application accounts will be prevented unless specifically \nrequired for an exceptional circumstance. \nTime-Limited Access: If interactive access is required, it will be restricted to the necessary timeframe to complete the required \ntask. \nBusiness Justification: A documented business justification must accompany any request for interactive login, explaining why \nsuch access is necessary.\nManagement Approval: Interactive use must be explicitly approved by management, ensuring that only authorized personnel can \nuse the account.\nAccountability: Every action taken using an interactive account must be attributable to an individual user. Individual user identity \nwill be confirmed before access is granted.\nApplication and system accounts will be tightly controlled to ensure that they are only used for necessary system operations, with interactive \naccess limited to exceptional circumstances and approved by management. Every action must be linked to an identifiable user to maintain \naccountability.\n3.8 Use of Utility Programs\nAccess to utility programs that have the potential to bypass normal operating system or application controls will be restricted to authorized \npersonnel to maintain the security and integrity of the company's systems.\nRestricted Access to Utility Programs: Only authorized system administrators will have access to manage utility programs such as \nanti-virus consoles, diagnostic tools, patching software, backup utilities, and network tools. These programs will be restricted from \ngeneral user access due to their ability to bypass normal security controls.\nPrivileged Utility Access Control: \nStandard User Restrictions: Standard users will be restricted from accessing privileged utilities or making modifications to their \nconfigurations.\n\nAuthentication and Access Controls: Strict authentication mechanisms and access controls will be implemented to ensure only \nauthorized administrators can access or modify utility programs, preventing unauthorized changes to the system.\nUtility programs with the ability to bypass security controls will be strictly restricted to authorized system administrators, with standard users \ndenied access. This ensures the integrity of system configurations and limits unauthorized access to privileged tools.\n3.9 Employee Termination/Offboarding Procedures\nThe company will revoke system and physical access for terminated users (employees, third parties, vendors, and other personnel) \npromptly to safeguard its systems and data.\nAccess Revocation: System and physical access will be revoked within one business day of the termination date. This applies to all \nterminated users including employees, vendors, and third parties.\nTermination Checklist and Notification:\nThe HR/People department, along with the users and their supervisors, are responsible for notifying system administrators of \nupcoming separations and ensuring the completion of a \"Termination Checklist.\"\nSystem administrators will terminate access rights within the established service level agreements (SLAs) upon notification of \ntermination or separation.\nAsset Return Tracking: \nThe HR/People department (or designated department) will track the return of all electronic and physical assets, including \nlaptops, files, access mechanisms (such as keys, access cards, badges, and multi-factor authentication tokens) as part of the \noffboarding process.\nIncident-Based Access Termination:\nSystem administrators will terminate a user's access if there is evidence or suspicion that:\nThe user has been misusing their access rights.\nA user's password has been compromised. If the user is not responsible for the password compromise, a new password may \nbe provided.\nUpon termination, the company ensures that access to systems and physical locations is revoked within one business day, while the \nHR/People department oversees asset returns and the completion of termination procedures. Access is also terminated if there is misuse or \nevidence of a password compromise.\n3.10 Disabling Accounts: High-Risk Users\nThe company will disable accounts of users deemed to pose a high risk to its systems and data. Accounts will be disabled for a specified \nperiod depending on the risk severity.\nUser intends to sell company information to a competitor Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser accesses unauthorized sensitive data without a business \nneed \nImmediately                 3 weeks                     \nUser deliberately attempts to bypass security controls Immediately                 6 weeks                     \nUser leaks confidential information to external parties Immediately                 2 months                    \nUser violates policy by sharing credentials Immediately                 2 weeks                     \nUser installs unauthorized software or malware Immediately                 1 month                     \nUser repeatedly fails to comply with security procedures Immediately                 4 weeks                     \nUser uses company resources for illegal activities Immediately                 Permanent Disablement       \nRiskTime Period to DisableDuration of Disablement\n\nHigh-risk accounts will be disabled promptly based on the nature of the risk and the severity of the violation.

All identified security findings, such as vulnerabilities in \nsoftware, systems, or processes, are tracked to resolution to ensure comprehensive remediation.\nReporting a Finding: Upon the identification of a vulnerability, a Jira ticket is created. This ticket includes a description of the finding, \nfurther details without any confidential information, and a link to the source of the issue.\nPriority Assignment: Each finding will be assigned a priority level within Jira based on its severity and potential impact on the \ncompany's systems and operations. The following priority levels are used:\nCritical\nHigh\nMedium\nLow\nTracking and Retention: The records of all findings are retained in Jira for a minimum period of 3 years, ensuring that the findings are \ndocumented for future audits, reviews, or follow-ups.\nRemediation Process: Once a finding is identified and recorded, it will be assigned to the owner responsible for the affected system or \nsoftware package. The assignee is responsible for addressing the finding according to the established Service Level Agreements \n(SLAs). Remediation can be completed through:\nImplementing a valid fix or mitigation.\nDetermining the finding is a false positive.\nDocumenting an approved exception when a fix is not feasible.\nValidation and Closure: After remediation, the finding is reassigned to the reporter or a member of the security team for validation. If \nvalidated, the finding is marked as closed in Jira. Fixes must be deployed to a development environment and have a targeted release \ndate for production deployment.\nThe company uses Jira to track and manage security vulnerabilities. All findings are reported, prioritized, and tracked to ensure they are \nremediated promptly, ensuring the security of the company's systems and data.\n3.5 Reporting a Finding\nUpon the identification of a vulnerability (whether in software, systems, or processes), a Jira ticket will be created.\nTicket Creation: A Jira ticket must be opened to record the vulnerability. This ticket acts as the primary means of documenting and \ntracking the issue through its lifecycle.\nDescription: The description of the finding should include comprehensive details about the vulnerability, while ensuring no confidential \ninformation is included. The description should provide a clear understanding of the issue and, where applicable, a link to the source of \nthe finding.\nPriority Assignment: The finding will be assigned a priority level in Jira based on its severity and potential impact. These levels include:\nCritical\nHigh\nMedium\nLow\nAll identified vulnerabilities are documented in Jira, with appropriate details and a priority level assigned. This process ensures \nvulnerabilities are properly tracked from discovery to remediation.\n3.6 Priority/Severity Ratings and Service Level Agreements\nIn order to address security vulnerabilities efficiently, the company has established the following timelines (Service Level Agreements - \nSLAs) for different priority levels. Each level is defined by its impact and specific examples.\nPriority LevelSLADescriptionImpactExamples\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities are categorized by their priority, with defined SLAs to ensure prompt resolution. The priority may change based on \nnew findings, which will adjust the response timeline accordingly.\n3.7 Priority Updates\nThe management of security vulnerabilities includes the flexibility to adjust priorities based on new information or a better understanding of \nthe impact and likelihood of exploitation. As a result, the following processes are applied when a priority is either upgraded or downgraded:\nPriority Upgrade: When new information or an increased threat is identified, the priority of a vulnerability may be upgraded (e.g., from \nMedium to High or Critical). In such cases, the SLA is reset, starting from the moment the escalation was made. This ensures that \nmore immediate attention is given to the vulnerability, and remediation efforts are accelerated based on its new urgency. The goal is to \nreflect the increased risk posed by the vulnerability and address it as quickly as possible.\nPriority Downgrade: When further analysis reveals that a vulnerability poses less risk than initially assessed, the priority may be \ndowngraded (e.g., from Critical to Medium). In this situation, the SLA remains unchanged and continues to follow the original timeline \nestablished when the vulnerability was first identified. This ensures that there is no undue delay in remediation, while still allowing for \nlower-priority vulnerabilities to be resolved within a more appropriate timeframe.\nThese updates help ensure that vulnerabilities are treated with the appropriate level of urgency and that remediation timelines remain \naligned with the evolving threat landscape.\n3.8 Resolving a Finding\nThe process for resolving a vulnerability finding is structured to ensure proper accountability and timely remediation. The following steps \noutline how findings should be handled:\nAssignment of Ownership: Each finding must be assigned to the owner responsible for the system, software package, or component \nwhere the vulnerability exists. The owner is accountable for ensuring that the finding is addressed appropriately.\nAddressing Findings Within SLAs: All findings must be resolved according to the established Service Level Agreements (SLAs) based \non the severity and priority level of the vulnerability. It is crucial that these timelines are adhered to, ensuring vulnerabilities are \nCritical 24-48 hoursImmediate action required; vulnerabilities \nthat pose an imminent threat, such as \nremote code execution, data theft, or \nadmin privilege escalation. These must be \naddressed as a top priority to prevent \nsevere impact.\nVulnerabilities causing \nprivilege escalation to \nadmin, remote code \nexecution, financial theft, \nunauthorized access, or \ndata extraction. \nRCE, Vertical \nAuthentication Bypass, \nSSRF, XXE, SQL Injection, \nUser Authentication \nBypass. \nHigh 3-7 daysHigh-risk vulnerabilities that could \nseriously affect security or business \noperations, but are less urgent than critical \nvulnerabilities. They still require swift \naction to prevent exploitation.\nVulnerabilities affecting \nthe platform's security \nand processes. \nLateral Authentication \nBypass, Stored XSS, some \nCSRF depending on \nimpact. \nMedium 15-30 daysModerate vulnerabilities that pose a risk \nbut require specific conditions to exploit, \nsuch as user interaction or specific \nconfigurations. These should be resolved \nwithin a month.\nVulnerabilities affecting \nmultiple users, requiring \nminimal user interaction \nto trigger. \nReflective XSS, Direct \nObject Reference, URL \nRedirect, some CSRF \ndepending on impact. \nLow 30-90 daysLow-risk vulnerabilities with minimal impact \nor requiring significant effort to exploit. \nThese can be addressed over a longer \nperiod but should still be tracked and \nresolved.\nIssues affecting singular \nusers, requiring \nsignificant interaction or \nprerequisites (e.g., MitM \nattacks). \nCommon flaws, Debug \nInformation, Mixed \nContent. \n\nremediated in a timely manner to minimize risks.\nRestrictions on Deployment: No software should be deployed to the production environment if it contains unresolved Critical or High \nfindings. An exception to this policy may be granted only if an approved Exception is in place, detailing compensating controls or \nacceptable risks for the specific case.\nResolution Methods: A vulnerability finding may be resolved by one of the following methods:\nFix/Mitigation: Providing and implementing a valid fix or mitigation that effectively addresses the identified vulnerability.\nFalse Positive: Determining that the finding is a false positive after proper validation, meaning the issue does not pose a real \nsecurity risk.\nApproved Exception: Documenting an approved exception, where a viable or immediate fix is not available, but compensating \ncontrols are in place to mitigate the risk.\nThis structured process ensures that vulnerabilities are systematically addressed, and that the organization remains protected from potential \nsecurity threats.\n3.9 Closing a Finding\nOnce a vulnerability finding has been addressed, the following steps must be followed to ensure proper closure:\nResolution and Comment: The assignee responsible for addressing the finding must provide a valid resolution, such as a fix, \nmitigation, or documented exception. A comment should be added to the finding in the tracking system detailing the resolution process.\nReassignment for Validation: After resolution, the finding should be re-assigned to the original Reporter or a designated member of the \nsecurity team for validation. This step ensures that the solution is reviewed and confirmed to have addressed the identified vulnerability.\nMarking the Finding as Closed: Upon successful validation by the security team or reporter, the finding can be marked as \"Done\" or \nclosed in the tracking system. However, before the finding is officially closed, the implemented fix must be deployed to a development \nenvironment for testing.\nProduction Release Planning: The final step before closure requires that the targeted release date for deploying the fix to the \nproduction environment is documented in the ticket. This ensures transparency and allows for tracking when the fix will be fully \nimplemented.\nThis process ensures that findings are not only resolved but also validated and tracked through to deployment, ensuring the security of \nsystems and compliance with internal standards.\n3.10 Exceptions\nIn certain cases, a viable or direct fix to a vulnerability may not be available. When this occurs, an Exception can be requested following the \nguidelines below:\nWhen to Request an Exception: An Exception may be necessary if the package version containing the fix is not supported on the \ncurrent operating system or if the fix introduces other technical constraints. \nCompensating Controls: In lieu of a direct fix, an alternative solution or compensating control must be implemented to mitigate the risk \nposed by the vulnerability. Compensating controls can be technical solutions or procedural changes and must address the original \nvulnerability effectively to lower the associated risk to an acceptable level.\nException Submission: The Exception must be formally requested through the tracking system (e.g., Jira) by creating a ticket \nspecifically for the Exception. The Exception ticket should include detailed information about why the vulnerability cannot be directly \naddressed, and a description of the compensating controls in place.\nReference to the Original Finding: The Exception ticket must be linked to the original vulnerability Finding by adding an Issue Link in \nthe tracking system, ensuring a clear connection between the two items.\nReview and Approval: Each Exception request must undergo a thorough review process. The Security Officer and the asset owner \nimpacted by the vulnerability must review and approve the Exception before it can be implemented. This ensures that the alternative \nsolution provides sufficient security and risk mitigation.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that all Exceptions are adequately documented, reviewed, and monitored, providing a controlled process \nfor managing vulnerabilities when a direct fix is not feasible.\n3.11 Malware Protection\nThe company will implement an anti-malware solution on all identified endpoints and system components at risk for malware. The anti-\nmalware solution will follow these guidelines:\nDetection and Removal: The anti-malware solution will be configured to detect all known types of malware and take appropriate \nactions, including removal, blocking, or containment of the malware to prevent damage or infection to company systems.\nAutomatic Updates: The anti-malware solution will be kept up-to-date automatically to ensure the system can defend against newly \nidentified threats.\nPeriodic and Real-Time Scanning: The anti-malware software will perform periodic scans and will continuously monitor the system via \nactive or real-time scanning. If behavioral analysis is implemented, it will monitor system processes for suspicious activities.\nRemovable Media Scans: When removable electronic media (e.g., USB drives) is inserted, connected, or logically mounted, the anti-\nmalware solution will automatically scan it for potential threats. If continuous behavioral analysis is enabled, the system will analyze the \nmedia for malware or other suspicious behavior throughout its use.\nAudit Logging: The anti-malware system will generate and retain audit logs of all malware scans, detections, and responses for a \nminimum period of 12 months. These logs will ensure traceability and monitoring of malware-related events.\nAccess Control: Configuration modifications to the anti-malware solution will be restricted to authorized personnel only. Regular users \nwill not be permitted to disable or alter the anti-malware protection mechanisms, except under specific circumstances where \nmanagement has documented and authorized an exception for a limited time.\nThe malware protection system will ensure comprehensive security by automating updates, scanning, and behavioral analysis. Controls \nover access to the anti-malware system will prevent unauthorized modifications, and audit logs will track system performance over time.\n3.12 Phishing Protection\nThe company will implement processes and automated mechanisms to detect and protect against phishing attacks aimed at personnel and \nsystems. The following measures will be included:\nEmail Security Protocols: Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) and DomainKeys Identified \nMail (DKIM) will be deployed to authenticate email origins and ensure that incoming emails are from trusted sources.\nLink Scrubbers: Automated systems will be used to scrub links within emails and web pages to detect and block malicious or suspicious \nURLs that may lead to phishing websites.\nServer-Side Antivirus: Server-side antivirus solutions will be used to scan emails and attachments before they reach user inboxes, \nreducing the risk of phishing and malware.\nContinuous Monitoring: Phishing detection systems will be continuously monitored to identify and respond to phishing attempts in real \ntime. Alerts and responses will be configured to mitigate risk and prevent users from interacting with phishing content.\nThe company will proactively guard against phishing attempts through automated email security protocols, link scrubbing technologies, and \nserver-side antivirus solutions. These mechanisms ensure the detection and mitigation of phishing threats before they reach personnel, \nenhancing overall cybersecurity.\n4 Document Administration\n4.1 Ownership and Review\n \nThe Document Owner owns this Document and is responsible for reviewing the Document for updates annually, or following any major \nchanges to Squirro AG's compliance environment.

The following \nrequirements are mandatory for maintaining the integrity and consistency of audit logs:\nTime Source: Logs must rely on accurate time sources, either International Atomic Time (TAI) or Coordinated Universal Time \n(UTC), to ensure uniformity across systems.\nNetwork Time Protocol (NTP): All servers and critical infrastructure must use NTP to synchronize their clocks with a central time server. \nThis ensures that the timestamps in audit logs are consistent across the environment.\nTime Synchronization Settings:\nAccess Control: Time synchronization settings will be restricted to authorized personnel only. Changes to the time settings must be \nlimited to those with a business need and appropriate permissions.\nLogging Changes: Any modification to time settings on critical systems must be logged, including details of the personnel making \nthe change and the reason for it.\nMonitoring: System logs must be continuously monitored to ensure that no unauthorized or unintended changes to the time settings \noccur. Any detected discrepancies will be flagged and reviewed.\nAuditing and Review: Regular reviews of time synchronization settings and logs will be conducted to detect any drift or misalignment in \ntime stamps, ensuring the accuracy of all logged events.\nThis synchronization mechanism helps ensure that all log entries are recorded with accurate and consistent timestamps, which is essential \nfor auditing, investigations, and compliance reporting.\n3.5 Protection of Audit Logs\nTo ensure the integrity and security of audit logs, the following controls will be implemented to safeguard logs from tampering by individuals \nwith elevated access or unauthorized users:\nAccess Control:\nRestricted Access: Read access to audit logs will be strictly limited to personnel with a job-related need. Only authorized \nindividuals responsible for monitoring or auditing system activity will be granted this access.\nAdministrator Restrictions: System administrators will be restricted from erasing, deactivating, or modifying logs of their own \nactivities if possible. This ensures transparency and accountability for administrative actions.\nBackup:\nCentralized Backup: All audit log files, including those related to external-facing technologies, will be backed up to a secure, \ncentralized internal log server or other secure media. These backups will be stored outside the direct control of system \nadministrators to prevent manipulation.\nRedundancy and Availability: Logs must be backed up on a regular basis, with redundancy measures in place to ensure log \navailability during recovery from failures or security incidents.\nBefore/After Values When applicable and feasible, records the before and after values of data elements that are updated as \npart of the action. \nDate and Time       The exact date and time the action was performed, including relevant time-zone information. For \nconsistency, logs should use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) when possible. \nAccess Control Outcome Whether the action was allowed or denied by the system's access control mechanisms. \nAccess Control Reason  In the event the action is denied, logs should contain descriptions or reason codes explaining why it \nwas blocked. \n\nFile Integrity Monitoring:\nChange Detection: A file integrity monitoring (FIM) or change-detection mechanism will be employed to monitor and protect audit \nlogs (where feasible based on system criticality, design and requirements). Any unauthorized or unexpected changes to the logs must \ngenerate real-time alerts.\nContinuous Monitoring: All log data will be subjected to continuous monitoring, with alerts configured to detect suspicious or \nmalicious activities targeting audit logs.\nReview and Accountability:\nPeriodic Reviews: Logs related to privileged user activities, including system administrators and operators, will be reviewed \nregularly to ensure compliance with security policies and detect any misuse or unauthorized actions.\nAccountability: All activities carried out by privileged users (e.g., system administrators) will be logged. These logs will be reviewed \nby security personnel and subjected to routine audits to maintain accountability.\nPrivileged Operations Logging:\nDelegated Operations: In instances where privileged operations have been delegated to the company by third parties or customers, \nthe performance of these operations will be logged and safeguarded. This ensures that all privileged actions are traceable and can \nbe audited when necessary.\nBy implementing these protections, the integrity and availability of audit logs are maintained, ensuring they provide reliable evidence for \naudits, investigations, and security monitoring.\n3.6 Monitoring\nFailures in critical security control systems must be detected, alerted, and resolved promptly to maintain the integrity of the company's \ninfrastructure. The systems that must be monitored include:\nNetwork Security Controls: \nIntrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): Monitors network traffic for suspicious activities and responds to threats.\nFirewalls: Ensures unauthorized network traffic is blocked, with real-time monitoring of firewall rule changes and suspicious \nconnection attempts.\nAccess Controls: \nPhysical Access Controls: Monitoring systems that track and alert on unauthorized physical access to sensitive areas such as data \ncenters (not applicable for cloud environment, maintained by cloud provider).\nLogical Access Controls: Ensuring that login attempts, failed logins, privilege escalations, and other access control mechanisms \nare actively monitored and alerting for unauthorized attempts.\nAudit Logs: \nAutomated Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of audit logs to detect anomalies, security breaches, and policy violations.\nPeriodic Reviews: Manual review of logs by authorized personnel to ensure adherence to company security policies and standards.\nChange Detection Mechanisms: \nFile Integrity Monitoring: Tracks and alerts on unauthorized changes to critical system files, configurations, and security settings.\nSystem Configuration Monitoring: Detects any unsanctioned system changes, such as unauthorized software installations or \nmisconfigurations.\nAnti-malware Solutions: \nThreat Detection: Continuous monitoring for malware infections, suspicious activity, and potential threats across systems, with \nautomatic alerts and incident reporting.\nFailures identified within any of these critical control systems must be addressed promptly in accordance with the incident response \npolicy. Actions include:\nRestoring Security Functions:\nSecurity functions must be immediately restored to minimize downtime and prevent further damage or compromise.\nDocumenting the Failure:\n\nDuration: Accurately recording the start and end times of the security failure.\nCause Identification: Investigating the root cause of the failure and documenting it comprehensively.\nAddressing Security Issues:\nImpact Assessment: Identifying and addressing any security risks or vulnerabilities exposed by the failure.\nRemediation: Implementing immediate fixes to resolve the issues, whether it is through patching, reconfiguring, or updating systems.\nEvaluating Future Risk:\nPreventative Actions: Implementing controls or improvements to prevent the reoccurrence of the failure.\nResuming Monitoring: Ensuring that the affected systems and controls are returned to full monitoring status to continue \nsafeguarding against future incidents.\nIncident Reporting:\nSecurity incidents resulting from control failures must be logged, reported, and shared with relevant stakeholders, including IT and \nsecurity teams, ensuring transparency and prompt action.\nBy enforcing continuous monitoring and establishing robust incident response mechanisms, the company ensures that failures in security \ncontrols are detected and addressed efficiently to minimize the impact on its operations and data security.\n4 Document Administration\n4.1 Ownership and Review\n  \n4.2 Monitoring and Enforcement\n4.3 Related Documents\n4.3.1 Internal documents\nInformation Security Policy \nInformation Security Organization Policy\nChange Management Policy \nConfiguration Management Plan  \n4.4 Approvals\nThe Document Owner owns this Document and is responsible for reviewing the Document for updates annually, or following any major \nchanges to Squirro AG's compliance environment.

It establishes the requirements for deploying, managing, and\nmaintaining network security controls to protect the company's IT systems from unauthorized access, threats, and vulnerabilities. The policy covers key areas such as firewall\nmanagement, intrusion detection systems, data flow monitoring, and the configuration of network devices. It emphasizes the use of a defense-in-depth strategy, ensuring that all network\ncomponents, including cloud infrastructure and web applications, are protected through layered security measures and regular reviews.\n\n4.5 Revision History\n1 Purpose and Scope\n1.1 Purpose\nThe Network Security Policy (further referred to as \"the policy\") outlines the company's approach to securing network infrastructure, \nprotecting sensitive data, and ensuring the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of IT systems at Squirro AG (further referred to as \"the \ncompany\"). This policy defines network security controls, configurations, and responsibilities required to safeguard company assets and \nprevent unauthorized access, threats, and vulnerabilities.\n1.2 Scope\nThe policy applies to:\nAll company personnel, contractors, and third-party providers interacting with company networks.\nAll network systems and assets, including physical and virtual servers, firewalls, routers, applications, and cloud infrastructure.\nAny external connections or systems that have access to company data or networks.\nAll tools and utilities used to monitor, manage, or secure network operations within the company's IT environment.\n1.3 Definitions\nFirewall: A network security control that controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an applied ruleset. A firewall \nestablishes a barrier between a trusted, secure internal network or host and a network or host that is assumed not to be secure and \ntrusted. Can be physical or virtual.\nHost Based Firewalls: Firewalls designed to protect an individual system regardless of the network that the system is connected to. \nHost-based firewalls are typically provided as an integral component of the host's Operating System (OS) or as a third-party software \nadd-on.\nNetwork Perimeter Firewalls: Firewalls located at the boundary between the internal network and external networks such as the \nInternet.

systems follow a consistent and repeatable \nSoftware Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process. This process will integrate information security at every stage to protect assets and \nmaintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\nStandardized Phases: Each software development project must follow defined SDLC phases: Determine System Need, Define System \nRequirements, Design System Components, Build System Components, Evaluate System Readiness, and System Deployment.\nIterative Cycles: Depending on the project management approach (Waterfall, Agile, Iterative), some SDLC phases can be combined or \niterated multiple times.\nSecure Engineering Principles: Security principles for business, data, application, and technology layers must be applied throughout \nthe SDLC to address risks identified via the company's information security risk assessments.\nThe company's SDLC ensures software development follows secure, standardized processes with integrated security measures at every \nstage, aligned with risk management strategies.\n3.2 Software Development Phases\nThe company's software development life cycle (SDLC) follows a structured approach consisting of several key phases, ensuring that both \nfunctional and security requirements are addressed at each step.\nDetermine System Need Phase: The initial phase where the system need is identified. During this phase, the business or technical \nneed for the system is evaluated, and resources are committed to address the requirement. This phase involves the identification of risks \nand opportunities for improving business processes through technology solutions.\nDefine System Requirements Phase: In this phase, user requirements are broken down into detailed technical specifications. Security \ncontrols and information security requirements are also identified through a risk assessment process. This ensures the system design \nincorporates adequate security measures to protect data and prevent vulnerabilities.\nDesign System Component Phase: The system's requirements are transformed into detailed specifications for system components. \nThe system's functional, interface, physical, and security requirements are fully defined during this stage. The design may be iterative, \nensuring that both functional and security considerations are revisited and updated.\nBuild System Component Phase: The system is constructed based on the design specifications. Each system component is coded, \ntested, and integrated with the larger system. Security testing is an integral part of this phase to identify and address potential \nvulnerabilities. Documentation for system installation, operations, and maintenance is also created during this phase.\nEvaluate System Readiness Phase: Independent testing is conducted to ensure that the system meets user requirements and security \nstandards. The system undergoes rigorous evaluation to measure performance, security, and overall readiness for deployment. This \nphase determines whether the system is ready to go live or if it requires redevelopment.\nSystem Deployment Phase: The system is deployed to an initial pilot site for further testing and then transitioned to the production \nenvironment. Training for users and administrators is completed in this phase to ensure proper operation of the system. Any remaining \nvulnerabilities identified during pilot testing are addressed before full-scale deployment.\n\nThe company's SDLC ensures that software projects move through well-defined phases, from initial need identification to deployment, with \nan emphasis on security and system readiness at each stage. By following this process, the company ensures the creation of secure, \nfunctional, and reliable software systems.\n3.3 Project Management\nThe sequence and structure of the software development phases depend on the specific project management approach selected for a given \nproject. Different methodologies can influence the way phases are implemented, including how they interact with one another and whether \nthey are completed sequentially or iteratively.\nWaterfall Development: This is a linear, sequential approach where each phase of the SDLC must be completed before moving on to \nthe next. It is often used for projects with well-defined requirements where changes are expected to be minimal during the development \nprocess.\nAgile Development: Agile development is a flexible, iterative approach that allows for continuous feedback and adaptation throughout \nthe project lifecycle. Small, functional increments of the software are developed and delivered in short cycles (sprints), enabling regular \nreview and adjustment.\nIterative Development: Iterative development allows for repeated cycles of development phases. The project moves through multiple \niterations of planning, design, development, and testing, refining the product in each iteration before arriving at the final release.\nStaged Delivery Development: This method focuses on delivering parts of the system incrementally in stages, with each stage \nrepresenting a functional subset of the final system. This approach allows parts of the system to be put into production early, providing \nvalue while subsequent stages are still in development.\nPhase Combination: Depending on the size and complexity of the software development project, some phases may be combined or \nrevisited. For example, in iterative development, multiple cycles of planning, design, development, and testing may occur before the final \nproduct is released.\nThe project management approach selected influences the sequence and flexibility of the development phases. Approaches such as Agile \nand Iterative Development enable more frequent feedback and adjustments, while Waterfall and Staged Delivery offer more structured, \nsequential development paths. By selecting the appropriate project management methodology, the company ensures that software \ndevelopment processes are both efficient and aligned with project needs.\n3.4 Secure System Engineering Principles\nInformation security implications must be considered throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Responsibilities for information \nsecurity must be clearly defined and allocated within the project management framework to ensure that security is embedded in every stage \nof development. The secure engineering principles are categorized into different layers, each with a focus on specific aspects of system \nsecurity.\n3.4.1 Business Layer\nThe Business Layer addresses the high-level requirements and ensures that security aligns with the company's objectives and risk \ntolerance.\nAlignment with Business Objectives: Ensure security measures align with business goals and risk management strategies.\nRisk Management: Identify and assess risks at each stage of the project and ensure that security controls address business-critical \nrisks.\nCompliance with Regulatory Requirements: Implement controls that ensure compliance with industry regulations (e.g., GDPR, \nHIPAA, ISO 27001).\nUser and Access Management: Ensure that access to systems and data is limited to authorized users based on business roles and \nresponsibilities.\n\n3.4.2 Data Layer\nThe Data Layer focuses on securing the data throughout its lifecycle, from creation to disposal.\nData Confidentiality: Protect sensitive data at rest and in transit using encryption methods that meet regulatory requirements (e.g., \nAES-256).\nData Integrity: Ensure that data is protected from unauthorized modification through hashing and integrity checks (e.g., HMAC, digital \nsignatures).\nData Availability: Implement redundancy and backup mechanisms to ensure data remains available in case of failure or disaster.\nData Minimization: Ensure that only necessary data is collected, retained, and processed, reducing exposure to potential data \nbreaches.\n3.4.3 Applications\nThe Application Layer involves designing and developing applications that are resilient to attacks and vulnerabilities.\nSecure Coding Practices: Use secure development practices, such as input validation, output encoding, and adherence to OWASP \nstandards, to prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).\nAuthentication and Authorization: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that \nonly authorized users can access the application.\nPatch Management: Ensure that applications are regularly updated and patched to address newly discovered vulnerabilities and \nthreats.\nApplication Security Testing: Conduct static and dynamic testing (e.g., SAST, DAST) to identify vulnerabilities before production \nrelease.\n3.4.4 Technology\nThe Technology Layer includes the technical infrastructure that supports the application and data, ensuring security at the network, \nsystem, and hardware levels.\nNetwork Security: Implement firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and network segmentation to protect \nagainst unauthorized access and lateral movement of threats.\nEndpoint Protection: Ensure that all endpoints (e.g., workstations, mobile devices) are equipped with security controls, such as anti-\nmalware tools, firewalls, and encryption.\nSecure Configuration: Apply secure configuration settings to operating systems, servers, and network devices, ensuring that default \nconfigurations are hardened.\nMonitoring and Logging: Implement continuous monitoring and logging of system events, network traffic, and application activity to \ndetect and respond to security incidents.\nThe secure system engineering principles aim to embed security across all layers of development, from business alignment to technology \ninfrastructure. By following these principles, the company ensures that information security is integrated into every aspect of system design, \ndevelopment, and operation.\n3.5 SDLC Security Control Guidelines\nThe company's Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process will adhere to robust security controls designed to safeguard information \nsystems and data. These controls will be applied throughout all phases of software development to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and \navailability of systems and data. \nSeparation of Duties: Adequate procedures must be established to ensure that duties related to the creation and approval of source \ndocuments are separated. Personnel assigned to the development/test environment must be different from those assigned to the \nproduction environment, ensuring clear segregation of responsibilities.\nChange Control Standard: All modifications to code or emergency releases must strictly follow the company's established change \ncontrol standard, ensuring proper documentation and approval of all changes before implementation.\n\nSecure Programming Standards: Secure coding practices must be followed in all software development activities to prevent common \nvulnerabilities and security risks. These practices must align with recognized frameworks such as OWASP and SANS.\nSecure Development Environment: The development environment must be designed and secured based on the following:\nData Sensitivity: The sensitivity of data being processed, stored, or transmitted must dictate the level of security in the development \nenvironment.\nCompliance: All internal and external regulatory requirements must be adhered to.\nPersonnel Trustworthiness: Only trusted and authorized personnel should have access to the development environment.\nOutsourcing Considerations: Security measures must account for the degree of outsourcing, if applicable, ensuring that external \nparties comply with the company's security policies.\nEnvironment Segregation: Development, test, and production environments must be clearly segregated to prevent unauthorized \naccess or data leakage between environments.\nAccess Controls: Access to the development environment must be controlled, logged, and monitored.\nChange Monitoring: All changes to the development environment and stored code must be monitored and audited.\nBackups: Data backups must be securely stored at offsite locations to ensure data availability in the event of a disaster.\nData Movement: Control over data movement to and from the development environment must be established to prevent \nunauthorized access or disclosure.\nThreat Modeling and Incident Reviews: Threat modeling must be conducted as part of the system design to identify and mitigate \npotential risks. Reviews of security incidents and contingency planning must also be in place to address vulnerabilities based on the \noperational environment.\nSecurity Vulnerabilities and Threat Prevention: All software deployed on corporate or hosted infrastructure must be designed to \nprevent security issues, including those outlined in OWASP and SANS. Static application security testing (SAST) or equivalent tools \nmust be used to detect vulnerabilities during the development process.\nCode Reviews: All code changes must undergo review by individuals other than the originating developer, with an emphasis on secure \ncoding practices. Reviews must be conducted by personnel knowledgeable in code review techniques and secure programming.\nOverrides and Approvals: Overrides of edit checks, approvals, and changes to confirmed transactions must be properly documented, \nauthorized, and reviewed.\nDevelopment and Production Environment Separation: Application development activities must be separated from production and \ntest environments, with enforced access controls. The extent of separation should be appropriate to the risk associated with the business \napplication and aligned with contractual requirements. Separation between production, development, and test environments should be \nevaluated regularly, and controls must be established to secure these environments.\nTest Environment Configuration: Test environments must mirror production environments as closely as possible to ensure accurate \ntesting outcomes and identify potential issues.\nChange Control in Production: All changes to production environments must adhere to the company's change control procedures. \nHuman approval from authorized individuals must be obtained for all changes. Automated updates should be disallowed without prior \napproval, and approval mechanisms must be enforced through automated systems wherever feasible (e.g., branch protection settings \non production code repositories).\nThe company's SDLC security controls are designed to ensure a secure, compliant, and well-managed development process. By following \nthese guidelines, the company safeguards its systems and data throughout the entire software development lifecycle.\n3.6 Secure Software Development Training and Practices\nThe company requires all personnel involved in supporting or writing bespoke or custom software to complete annual security training that \nfocuses on secure coding practices. This is particularly important for individuals involved in developing or supporting internet-facing \napplications, where specific threats related to online vulnerabilities are more prevalent.\nAnnual Security Training: All individuals writing or supporting custom software must complete secure coding training annually. This \ntraining must be completed prior to engaging in any software development or support activities. The training will include the most recent \nOWASP secure development principles and awareness of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.\n\nSpecialized Internet Threat Training: For those supporting or writing internet-facing applications, additional training must cover security \nthreats that are specific to the web, including techniques for defending against common internet-based attacks.\nAccount and Credential Security: Custom accounts, user IDs, and passwords must be removed from all applications before they are \ndeployed or released to customers to avoid potential backdoor vulnerabilities.\nProhibition on Production Data in Testing: Production data should not be used in development or test environments. Testing must be \nconducted with anonymized or synthetic data to prevent unauthorized exposure of sensitive information.\nProduction Quality Controls in Test Systems: Security controls applied to the production environment must be mirrored in test \nenvironments to ensure consistency. The test environment should match the production environment as closely as possible to simulate \nreal-world conditions while maintaining security.\nQuality Assurance (QA) Testing: QA processes prior to the release of new features must include thorough testing of user input \nconstraints. This testing must cover edge and boundary cases to identify potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited through \nunexpected user behavior.\nThe company mandates comprehensive secure coding training and practices to ensure that software development and support activities \nadhere to the highest standards of security. By focusing on secure development principles, mirroring production controls, and emphasizing \nrigorous QA testing, the company minimizes the risk of vulnerabilities in its applications.\n3.7 Production Data Use in Testing\nIn situations where production data must be used for testing purposes, stringent controls must be followed to ensure the confidentiality, \nintegrity, and security of the data. The following requirements outline the process for safely handling production data during testing:\nApproval Requirement: The Information Resource Owner must provide explicit approval before production data can be used in any \ntesting environment.\nData Anonymization: Wherever possible, production data should be tokenized, anonymized, removed, or de-identified to avoid \nexposing sensitive information during the testing process.\nSeparation of Data: Testing and parallel runs must use a separate copy of production data, and the test location must meet security \nstandards (e.g., loading confidential production data onto unsecured devices such as laptops is prohibited).\nRestricted Handling: Production data must not be extracted, handled, or used in a way that exposes it to unauthorized access. Data \nhandling must follow strict protocols to prevent unauthorized disclosure.\nAccess Control: Only personnel with a documented business need may access production data for testing, and access must follow the \nsame control procedures as those used in operational environments.\nAuthorization for Test Data: Each instance of copying operational data to a test environment must receive separate authorization, \nensuring that only necessary data is transferred.\nAudit Logging: All instances of copying production data into a test environment must be logged, and audit trails must be maintained for \nfuture review.\nLimited Access: Production data must be restricted to users with a documented business need, and only the necessary information \nshould be accessible to those users. The access control process must ensure that only authorized personnel are permitted to interact \nwith the data.\nData Erasure: Production data used for testing purposes must be securely erased once testing is complete to prevent any further \naccess or exposure.\nTest Data Removal: All test data and user accounts created during the testing phase must be removed prior to the system's deployment \ninto a production environment.\nData Encryption: Any Restricted or Protected Information used in testing must be encrypted according to the company's Encryption \nStandard, both while at rest and during transit.\nUsing production data for testing purposes must be strictly controlled. Approval from the Information Resource Owner is required, and data \nmust be anonymized or tokenized wherever feasible. Only authorized personnel can access production data, and all data transfers must be \nlogged for auditing. Data must be securely erased upon completion of testing, ensuring sensitive information remains protected.\n\n3.8 Outsourced Production Security Requirements\nWhen production is outsourced, the company must implement stringent controls across the entire external supply chain. These controls are \ndesigned to ensure compliance with security, quality, and contractual obligations, in conjunction with the requirements outlined in the Vendor \nManagement Policy.\nLicensing and Intellectual Property: Licensing arrangements, code ownership, and intellectual property rights related to outsourced \ncontent must be clearly defined and agreed upon. The company retains ownership of its intellectual property and must ensure all \nlicensing agreements are valid and secure.\nSecure Development Requirements: The company must establish contractual requirements for secure design, coding, and testing \npractices with external developers. This includes ensuring all security protocols are adhered to during development.\nThreat Model Provision: The company must provide the approved threat model to external developers to ensure they are aware of all \nsecurity considerations and risks associated with the project.\nAcceptance Testing: All deliverables must undergo thorough acceptance testing for quality, accuracy, and security. This testing ensures \nthe product meets the company's functional and security requirements.\nSecurity Thresholds: External developers must provide evidence that security thresholds have been applied to establish minimum \nacceptable levels of security and privacy quality for the deliverables.\nTesting for Malicious Content: Sufficient testing must be conducted to ensure the deliverables are free from both intentional and \nunintentional malicious content. Evidence of these tests must be provided by the external developer.\nVulnerability Testing: External developers must provide evidence that thorough testing has been conducted to identify and mitigate \nknown vulnerabilities. This includes using tools to detect security weaknesses in the code and system.\nEscrow Arrangements: In the event that source code or critical deliverables are no longer available from the external developer, escrow \narrangements must be made to ensure continued access to the software for future development or maintenance.\nRight to Audit: The company reserves the contractual right to audit the external developer's processes, controls, and adherence to \nsecurity standards.
